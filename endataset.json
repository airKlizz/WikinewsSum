The candidacy of Barghouti, who supports violence but says he wants peace with Israel, could shake up the calcified world of Palestinians politics. By law, elections are to be held by Jan. 9, or within 60 days of Arafat's death on Thursday Many believe the popular Barghouti is the only leader capable of unifying squabbling Palestinian factions, reining in militants and possibly restarting peace efforts with Israel. Israel, however, is determined not to free Barghouti, who is serving multiple life terms for his role in the killings of four Israelis and a Greek monk. Barghouti also could represent the best hope for Arafat's Fatah movement to beat down a challenge by the increasingly popular hardline Islamic militant group Hamas, which is considering running a candidate. ``When he takes that decision (to run), we will be near him and we will support him,'' said Ahmed Ghneim, a senior Fatah leader and another member of the younger guard. ``I think he has the best chances of anybody in the movement to win the elections.'' Barghouti's wife, Fadwa, said she was unaware of her husband's plans. But his brother Hisham said: ``His people around him, from the Fatah and Tanzim (Fatah rank-and-file), want him, and if they want him, he is looking to be president.'' After Arafat's death Thursday, Parliament Speaker Rauhi Fattouh was sworn in as the caretaker leader of the Palestinian Authority. Though some officials have talked of amending the law to allow parliament to choose the new leader, Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia said Saturday that elections would be held by Jan. 9. Fattouh was to meet Sunday with elections officials to decide whether to hold the poll Jan. 7 or Jan. 9, Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat said. Ammar Dweik, deputy chairman of the Palestinian election commission, said the Palestinians were ready to hold their first presidential election since 1996, noting that a voter registration drive was recently completed. ``There is a political will to conduct the elections,'' he said. ``We are ready technically. All we need is a decree to set a date.'' Rami Hamdallah, chairman of the Palestinian election committee, called on the international community to pressure Israel to allow the elections to go smoothly, especially in disputed east Jerusalem. Israeli police raided registration stations several months ago, preventing most east Jerusalem residents from registering. A senior Israeli official said on condition of anonymity that Israel had not been formally contacted about the matter. Another question is whether Hamas will field a candidate. Osama Hamdan, a Hamas leader in Beirut, Lebanon, said the group is deliberating whether to run a candidate. A senior Hamas official in Gaza, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the group's leaders would meet soon and were considering the issue seriously. Arafat's death raised speculation Israel might release Barghouti as a goodwill gesture, but Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom ruled that out. ``He will remain in prison for the rest of his life, because he's a murderer, because he's responsible for the killing of so many'' innocent people, Shalom said Thursday. Barghouti intends to run regardless, and will only bow out of the race if Fatah holds primaries and he loses, the person close to Barghouti said on condition of anonymity. Erekat said the Fatah candidate will likely be chosen by the movement's small central committee and not in a primary. The committee would likely nominate Mahmoud Abbas, 69, an old guard politician who has taken over Arafat's role as head of the PLO. It is far from certain, though, whether Abbas could defeat a Hamas candidate. Many Palestinians see Abbas' generation of politicians, many of whom spent decades in exile, as a corrupt clique with little connection to the Palestinian masses. Younger leaders who cut their teeth during the first Palestinian uprising in the 1980s and early 1990s have more grass-roots support, but have largely been frozen out of top positions in Fatah, the PLO and the Palestinian Cabinet. Barghouti, a former West Bank leader of Fatah, has firm street credentials. He spent six years in Israeli jails before being deported in 1987, and was one of the first exiles to return seven years later after interim peace deals with Israel were signed. He once had close ties to Israeli peace activists, and speaks fluent Hebrew that he learned in prison. But after the outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian fighting four years ago, he said force - including shooting attacks on Israelis - was justified to end Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Regardless, he still says he supports peace. Barghouti was considering running along with a vice president - a position that currently does not exist - who would handle the daily administration of the Palestinian Authority while he remains in prison, the person close to Barghouti said. Pressure on Israel to release Barghouti would become intense if he wins. ``If the Palestinians are going to make this work against the really hard-line elements, the Islamists and some of the people of Hamas, they're going to have to have a coalition of the young guard and the old guard,'' former Secretary of State James Baker told CNN on Friday. ``It would be really a very positive step in the right direction if Israel would release Marwan Barghouti so that he could participate in bringing about this transition.'' Meanwhile, Palestinian officials worked to chart their future after Arafat, expressing hope for new peace moves in the region. Hours after Arafat's burial Friday, President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair pledged their support for new peace talks. Qureia said Saturday they must follow through. ``I'm saying to the American administration, to President Bush, to the Israelis and to the whole world, 'Now is the period where we should be more serious,''' he said. ``If we are determined to do it, we can do it in a very short time.' Israel has said it wanted the new Palestinian leadership to prove itself before peace talks resume. Shalom is to meet Monday with U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, and the State Department said Powell will travel to the region ``soon'' to meet with Palestinian leaders.", "title": "Barghouti to Run for Palestinian Leader", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-4613488,00.html", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041121012116/http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-4613488,00.html"}]}

Bush has chosen national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, one of his closest confidantes, to replace resigning Secretary of State Colin Powell, senior administration officials said on Monday. The deputy national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, will replace Rice, the officials said. Bush is expected to make both announcements on Tuesday. Rice's nomination requires Senate confirmation; Hadley's appointment as national security adviser does not. Powell's resignation was announced earlier on Monday. Rice has been national security adviser since Bush took office in January 2001. Of his top aides, she spends more time with the president than any other except White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card. She was at his side at all times in the run-up to the Iraq war. In April, she gave dramatic testimony to the commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, in which she rejected criticism that the Bush administration was negligent in the summer before the attacks and said there was no \"silver bullet\" that could have averted them. She was frequently at Bush's side on the campaign trail and often travels with the Bush family to the Camp David retreat on weekends. Rice had been talked about as a possible successor to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and that job was believed to have been her preference, but there has been no indication that Rumsfeld is leaving any time soon. Rice, who turned 50 on Sunday, was given a surprise birthday party on Saturday night at the British embassy. The black-tie event was attended by Bush and his wife, Laura. She was previously the provost of Stanford University and has debated whether to quit her high-stress Washington life and return there. But many of her aides believed if Bush told her that he needed her to stay, she would do so. Rice's training was in Russian affairs, but in her current job, she has focused on all the world's hot spots. She met with Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie in Berlin in May in what was the highest-level U.S. contact with Qurie at the time. In mid-July she traveled to Asia for meetings with officials in Japan, South Korea and China. Before his appointment as deputy national security adviser, Hadley served as a senior foreign and defense policy adviser to Bush during the presidential campaign and worked in the transition on the National Security Council. Hadley last year accepted blame for a reference to Iraq seeking uranium in Niger that showed up in Bush's January 2003 State of the Union speech and sparked a controversy after it was shown to be based on forged documents. George Tenet, then director of the CIA, had also taken responsibility for the inclusion of the false accusation in the address. Hadley served as the assistant secretary of Defense for international security policy from 1989-1993 and was a partner in a Washington, D.C. law firm.

Powell\nWashington, DC\nNovember 15, 2004 (1:05 p.m. EST) SECRETARY POWELL: Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As you know from the White House announcement earlier today, I submitted my resignation as Secretary of State to President Bush on Friday. It has been my great honor and privilege to have been once again given the opportunity to serve my nation, and I will always treasure the four years that I have spent with President Bush and with the wonderful men and women of the Department of State. I think we have accomplished a great deal. My purpose here today is not to give you a listing of what we have done over the last four years, but to just take note of the fact that in recent weeks and months, President Bush and I have talked about foreign policy and we've talked about what to do at the end of the first term. It has always been my intention that I would serve one term. And after we had had a chance to have good and fulsome discussions on it, we came to the mutual agreement that it would be appropriate for me to leave at this time. Now, I'm not leaving today. I just offered my resignation and I would expect to act fully as Secretary of State until the day that I do leave, and I suspect that will be a number of weeks or a month or two as my replacement goes through the confirmation process. We have a full end-of-year agenda in front of us, beginning with a trip to Chile on Wednesday, and then off to Egypt and other places, and then a full series of European and other meetings in December. And I fully intend for the Department to work as hard as it has in recent years to push forward the President's foreign policy agenda. Many challenges out there, but many opportunities out there, and I can assure you that I'll be working hard until the very, very end. And I thank President Bush and I thank the American people for giving me this opportunity to serve the nation once again. I'll take one or two questions, then I do have other things I have to do. Barry. QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I have one or two questions. Why now, but you sort of answered that. Secondly, or firstly, what do you think are the biggest pieces of unfinished business, business that has to be addressed, maybe on an urgent basis? SECRETARY POWELL: We have to make sure that we continue to pursue the global war against terror, we have to consolidate the very significant gains we've seen in Afghanistan, and we have to make sure we defeat this insurgency in Iraq. I think a new opportunity has presented itself in the Middle East and President Bush has spoken to this, and hopefully over the next few weeks I'll be able to see how much potential there is in this new opportunity in the Middle East with the passing of Chairman Arafat. And beyond that, I think we have to just keep working on the broad agenda that we have had for the past four years, strengthening our alliances. We have solid alliances in Asia, with Japan and South Korea and the Philippines and Thailand and Australia; make sure that we use our alliances in Asia and the partnerships we have in Asia to keep pressing to find a solution to the North Korean nuclear program. We have to work with our European Union friends and with the IAEA to find a solution to the Iranian nuclear program, and we have seen a little bit of progress, hopefully, over the last 24 hours. The President also has an active agenda with respect to trade, open trade, with respect to the Millennium Challenge Account and development funding, going after HIV/AIDS, building on the partnerships and alliances that we have around the world. We had some difficulties with some nations in Europe last week -- last year over Iraq and we are getting rid of those differences and coming together again, as evidenced by the fact that NATO is now undertaking a mission in support of the Iraqi people. And so I think there are still challenges out there, but I think there are far more opportunities out there. We've got good relations with China, the best, perhaps, in decades, good relations with India, with Pakistan, with the Russian Federation. And all of this, I think, is a result of our foreign policy efforts over the last four years under President Bush's leadership. QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, -- SECRETARY POWELL: Let me go back to Steve. Steve. Did you have your hand up, Steve? No? Yes? QUESTION: Let me follow-up on Barry's question about the timing, be more specific, when you said that in recent weeks and months you have been discussing with President Bush this prospect. Can you be a little bit more detailed about when it was decided and when you told him? SECRETARY POWELL: I meet with the President almost every day in some form of a meeting and at least once a week we have our private time. And in the course of the year, frankly, we have talked about the second term. And I have always indicated to him that I thought I would serve for one term. And as we got closer to the election and the immediate aftermath of the election, it seemed the appropriate time and we were in mutual agreement that it was the appropriate time for me to move on. QUESTION: Mr. Secretary. SECRETARY POWELL: Yes. QUESTION: Just to follow up. QUESTION: Mr. Secretary -- SECRETARY POWELL: Follow up. QUESTION: Did you offer to stay for a little while, some period of months or something, and did the President just choose to say, let's do the letter now? SECRETARY POWELL: I made no offer. We had pretty much come to our mutual agreement without anybody having to make any offer, counteroffers, anything like that. We knew where we were heading. QUESTION: Mr. Secretary. SECRETARY POWELL: Yes. MR. BOUCHER: Finish up now. QUESTION: Do you plan on visiting the Palestinian territories, sir, in the next week or so? And how effective do you think you can be in bringing the process back into track? SECRETARY POWELL: I'm still working on my schedule, so I don't have an announcement for you now. But I'm meeting with Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom this afternoon, so I will remain engaged either here or by telephone or in the region. And of course, when I'm in Sharm el-Sheikh, I'll have the opportunity to see a number of Arab leaders but I don't have a complete schedule in place yet. I think I have time for one more. Tammy. QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, of all the things you've done in government -- QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, to what extent do you feel that your resignation now will affect your ability to carry out what you intend to carry out over the next few weeks, and what do you intend to do next? SECRETARY POWELL: With respect to the first question, I'm still the Secretary of State, and as President Bush has made it clear, I operate with his full authority. And so, I think that will be recognized by the people that I deal with around the world and I have good relations with most of the leaders in the nations that I will be working with and visiting, so I think I'll be able to be quite effective for the remaining period of my term. And what am I going to do next? I don't know. Okay. Arshad. QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, of all the things you've done in government, as Secretary of State, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, National Security Advisor, two combat tours in Vietnam, what has been the most satisfying experience of your government service and what has been your greatest regret? SECRETARY POWELL: I have avoided assiduously over the many years of my career to sort of single out one being more important or best than the other. Each and every one of the things that I have done in a career of service that now is almost 40 years, they all were important, they all had meaning to me, they all in some way or another, in my judgment, contributed to the welfare of our nation, whether it was being a second lieutenant in Germany or being the Secretary of State. The greatest pleasure comes from working with likeminded people in all of the organizations I have been a part of serving the nation. In every one of these jobs there have been high points and low points, and what you have to learn to do in government, or in life, is to work through problems, seize the opportunities as they come along, deal with the crises and challenges as they come along, and that's always the way I've tried to live my life in public service. And the greatest privilege I've had over the last four years is to be the leader of tens of thousands of wonderful employees of this Department, whether they're Civil Servants, Foreign Service Officers, management specialists, Foreign Service Nationals, who work so hard on the front lines of freedom and the front lines of our foreign policy, who are at risk every single day and serve our nation so proudly. And it has been a privilege for me to have been given the opportunity to lead them for these last four years, and I will lead them up until the day I depart.

The bank denies any wrongdoing.\nIn the latest in a series of congressional investigations of alleged corruption in the oil-for-food program, the House International Relations Committee was homing in on the role of the U.S. branch of BNP-Paribas, which handled most of the oil-for-food money.\nThe humanitarian program, begun in 1996, allowed Iraq to trade oil for goods to help Iraqis get food, medicine and other necessities that became scarce under strict U.N. economic sanctions imposed after the Gulf War. It was credited with preventing widespread starvation.\nCommittee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill, said the panel found evidence that BNP in some cases improperly approved payments of oil-for-food funds to companies that weren\u2019t supposed to receive them. The bank may also have allowed payments to companies that were shipping to Iraq goods prohibited by international sanctions.\n\u201cThere are indications that the bank may have been noncompliant in administering the oil-for-food program,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cIf true, these possible banking lapses may have facilitated Saddam Hussein\u2019s manipulation and corruption of the program.\u201d\nHe said he was providing the committee\u2019s findings to the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees banking issues.\nA BNP official, Everett Schenk, said the bank complied with U.S. laws, adhered to Treasury Department rules and followed U.N. guidelines. He said all contracts were reviewed by a U.N. committee that oversaw the oil-for-food program.\n\u201cAll of the concerns that we are aware of we believe have been satisfactorily resolved,\u201d said Schenk, chief executive of the bank\u2019s North American corporate and investment banking operations.\nBut Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., said a review of 80 payments found three instances in which payments were made to a third-party that apparently wasn\u2019t supposed to be involved in the transactions.\nSchenk said he didn\u2019t have details of those payments and offered to discuss them with committee staff in the future.\nA series of investigations have found that Saddam, as Iraqi president, used oil smuggling, bribes and kickbacks to generate up to $21.3 billion or more in illegal revenue while under international sanctions from 1991-2003.\nThough smuggling accounted for most of that money, the most sensational revelations have involved the oil-for-food program, with allegations that Saddam and his aides bribed U.N. and foreign officials in an effort to break down the sanctions.\n\u201cWe all knew that Saddam was doing everything in his power to evade sanctions,\u201d said the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Tom Lantos of California. \u201cBut it is truly infuriating to discover the depth of the contempt and greed displayed by the governments of nations such as France, Russia and Syria who evidently jumped at the chance to participate in Saddam\u2019s crimes against the international community.\u201d\nHyde said the committee found evidence that Saddam used kickback revenues to make $25,000 payments to families of Palestinian suicide bombers who carried out attacks on Israel.\nLawmakers have clashed with U.N. officials over what documents would be provided to congressional investigators. The United Nations has raised concerns that congressional investigations could interfere with an inquiry by a committee led by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. That committee was appointed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in April to investigate corruption allegations.\nOn Tuesday, Volcker told leaders of a Senate subcommittee investigating oil-for-food that the committee won\u2019t hand over documents until its own investigative reports are issued starting in January.\nVolcker also said he opposed letting U.N. staff or contractors testify before Congress because it could risk their cooperation with his investigation. Volcker was responding to a letter from Sens. Norm Coleman, R-Minn. and Carl Levin, D-Mich., respectively chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\nColeman said in a statement Wednesday that Volcker assured him in a conversation Tuesday \u201cthat any efforts to thwart our investigation, or prevent my staff from interviewing witnesses, would come to an end.\u201d\nHyde warned that \u201cif cooperation from those agencies and institutions involved in this program continues to be inadequate, then we will exercise such enforcement remedies as the law makes available to us.

Promises Pandemonium For Walt Disney World Guests Disney News Stitch's Great Escape Promises Pandemonium For Walt Disney World Guests Mischievous Alien Busts Loose at Magic Kingdom attraction with opening date of November 16 LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- Fans of Walt Disney Pictures' hit film \"Lilo & Stitch\" know him as a cuddly but destructive alien prone to hilarious fits of havoc. But what was Stitch like before the movie? Walt Disney World guests will find out when they come face to face with the mischievous character in a new Magic Kingdom attraction -- Stitch's Great Escape! The official opening date for Stitch's Great Escape is November 16. The laughter-filled Tomorrowland adventure puts guests in the middle of the mayhem caused by the naughty \"Experiment 626\" -- a.k.a. Stitch -- when he's captured by the Galactic Federation and teleported to a processing center for alien prisoners. Park guests are recruited to provide additional security when the six-limbed alien arrives with a reputation for playful disobedience -- and an appetite for chaos that exceeds all limits. Sights, sounds and -- ewwww! -- smells add to the pandemonium. Parents, take note: Stitch's Great Escape! includes periods of darkness and loud noises. Guests are urged to read posted caution signs before entering. Bringing a character from an animated film to life as an Audio-Animatronics figure presented a unique challenge for Walt Disney Imagineers. The result is a 39-inch-tall version of the unstoppable blue menace animated with a breathtaking degree of realism, one of the most complex creations of its size, custom-made by Imagineers with more than 350 detailed, hand-machined parts and more than 40 separate functions. In addition to Stitch, the fun-filled attraction features several characters familiar to fans of the film, including the Galactic Federation's Grand Councilwoman, Captain Gantu and Agent Pleakley, with voices supplied by the movie's original actors. Also featured are two \"plasma cannons\" that follow Stitch's DNA whenever -- and wherever -- it moves. Stitch's Great Escape! offers Disney's FASTPASS, the innovative free service available to all guests that eliminates the need to wait in long lines at popular attractions. Online, fans of the crafty alien can learn more about the new attraction and help Stitch explore Magic Kingdom in Stitch's Escape Game, a free download available for Windows PCs at www.stitchescape.com.

But some medical organisations argued the pace was too slow and the measures did not go far enough, while the pub trade hinted that publicans would sidestep the ban.\nIt will be implemented in stages, applying to government offices and the NHS by 2006, in all workplaces (eliminating office smoking rooms) by 2007 and in pubs and restaurants serving food - 80-90 per cent of the total - by the end of 2008.\nThe only public places where it will be legal after that will be pubs that do not serve food and private clubs where the members agree to it. Smoking may also be permitted in hospices, prisons and residential homes.\nA legal ban was not expected from the Health Secretary who had declared he was opposed to \"nannying\". But protecting other people from the damage caused by cigarette smoke justified this exception, he told the Commons yesterday.\nThe decision to exempt pubs that do not serve food and private clubs from the ban provoked charges of a \"bodge\" and \"missed opportunity\". Professor Alex Markham, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said it was bizarre to accept the wisdom of a ban but then deny its benefits to people who worked in licensed premises where food was not served. He said: \"The Government has failed in its fundamental duty to protect our citizens' health and safety by opting out of a total ban. It's like having the legislation to fit all cars with seatbelts because we know seatbelts save lives and then stopping some passengers from wearing them.\"\nBut the Tories accused Mr Reid of adopting Old Labour interventionism.

The white paper on public health in England, Choosing Health, went further than some expected in restricting tobacco in public places - smoking at the bar will be illegal even in pubs where cigarettes are not banned - but the emphasis was on allowing individuals to make their own health choices, with NHS support where wanted. Food and advertising industries were also given the chance to respond to concerns about their part in tackling the obesity epidemic, while an industry-funded lobby group was left in control of health messages related to sensible drinking. The medical profession was disappointed but Mr Reid said: \"In a free society, men and women ultimately have the right within the law to choose their own lifestyle, even when it may damage their own health. But people do not have the right to damage the health of others, or to impose an intolerable degree of inconvenience or nuisance to others. We therefore intend to shift the balance significantly in favour of smoke-free environments.\" Justifying his decision not to implement a total smoking ban in public places, he said: \"I am not a medical officer. I'm a politician charged with maintaining a free democratic society ... A lot of effort is about making sure that people who cannot afford personal trainers and lifestyle gurus - all those whose needs have been ignored for 60 years - are going to get their needs met.\" He said about \u00a31bn would be devoted to putting proposals into action and that could save \u00a330bn in preventable ill health over the next few years. The mantra behind the white paper shifts public health approaches from \"advice from on high to support from next door\", and central to this is the appointment of NHS-accredited \"health trainers\" to whom people can turn for advice. These will at first be available only in the 20% of local primary care trusts with the worst healthy and deprivation profiles, but will later spread throughout England. These trainers are likely to be a mix of health professionals, volunteers and community workers, and they will first be properly trained. These \"health stock-takers\" will draw up guides against which people can then measure their own progress. The government also plans a new NHS service, Health Direct, available via telephone, internet and digital television, to offer information on health choices. There is also a bigger onus on employers to help reduce sickness absence that costs at least \u00a311bn a year. People were often apprehensive about returning to work, said the government, and companies should do more to put their minds at rest. Tim Lord, chief executive of the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association, said: \"This goes beyond what the public has said it wants. We are disappointed at this missed opportunity to strike the right balance between sensible regulation and voluntary measures that accommodate non-smokers and smokers alike.\" Anti-smoking campaigners Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) said Dr Reid had made a \"ridiculous bodge\" in his smoke-free proposals. \"There is no excuse at all for the government to accept that secondhand smoke is a serious health and safety issue, and then to try to exempt some of the employees most at risk,\" Ash director Deborah Arnott said. Professor Alex Markham, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, described the move as a \"huge missed opportunity\". \"It seems bizarre that the government has accepted the wisdom of a ban but is then happy to deny the benefits of it to people who work in private clubs and pubs where food is not served,\" he said.\nText Alerts Get the day's top headlines straight to your mobile\nSign up for the Backbencher Our free weekly insider's guide to Westminster\nWhat do you think?

John Reid, the Health Secretary, found himself under attack from anti-smoking campaigners for introducing \"half-measures\" while the Tories said he was adopting a \"nanny state approach\" by extending the role of Whitehall into \"individual liberty and lifestyle\". Mr Reid, 57, who has given up both alcohol and cigarettes, said smoking would be outlawed in 90 per cent of pubs if Labour won the next election. He said the Government was protecting the rights of the majority to go to work or out for a meal or drink without the \"damage, inconvenience or pollution\" from second-hand smoke - while allowing a much more limited choice for the minority who smoked. The curbs were the most controversial element of the 206-page White Paper, Choosing Health. Other major proposals included restrictions on the promotion of unhealthy foods to children, clear labelling of the nutritional content of food, action to curb \"binge drinking\" and tackle sexually transmitted diseases, and NHS \"trainers\" to provide advice to individuals on healthy lifestyles. advertisement Mr Reid, who earlier this year said a cigarette was sometimes the only enjoyment available to a \"21-year-old single mother of three on a council estate\", said the smoking ban would be applied in stages. Government departments and the NHS would lead the way - all being smoke-free by the end of 2006. By the end of 2007, all enclosed public places and workplaces would be smoke-free. By the end of 2008 arrangements for licensed premises would be in place. All restaurants and pubs and bars preparing and serving food would be smoke-free. Other pubs and bars not serving prepared food would be free to choose whether to allow smoking or not. So would membership clubs, such as golf clubs. But smoking in the area around the bar would be prohibited in all premises to protect staff. Kenneth Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor and deputy chairman of British American Tobacco, the cigarette manufacturer, accused ministers of allowing \"puritan bureaucrats and campaigners\" to tell people how to lead their lives. \"It is not just tobacco. It is alcohol, it is chips, chocolate and McDonald's hamburgers,\" he told ITN. The British Beer and Pub Association, which represents 40,000 public houses, accused Mr Reid of introducing a \"ban on eating\" in pubs rather than a ban on smoking. There would be a clear incentive for publicans to shut their kitchens to avoid the regulations. Prof Alex Markham, of Cancer Research UK, said it was \"bizarre\" that the Government had accepted the wisdom of a ban but was then happy to deny its benefits to staff in private clubs. Action on Smoking on Health said Mr Reid's last-ditch defence of smoking in pubs and clubs had led to a \"ridiculous bodge\". Second-hand smoke was a serious health issue for pub staff. Mr Reid accepted that men and women had a right within the law to choose their own lifestyle, even when it might damage their health. \"But people do not have the right to damage the health of others, or to impose an intolerable degree of inconvenience or nuisance on others. We therefore intend to shift the balance significantly in favour of smoke-free environments,\" he added. Mr Reid said at least \u00a31 billion would be spent by the Government on public health in the next three years and claimed that there could eventually be savings of \u00a330 billion by tackling preventable illnesses. Andrew Lansley, the Conservative health spokesman, accused Mr Reid of offering \"gimmicks and threats of a nanny state\". He said the Secretary of State wanted a \"Carole Caplin\" approach to health policy, recruiting lifestyle gurus when the NHS was short of physiotherapists, midwives and district nurses.

Beijing thus now gets less of Japanese largess, and there is public support to cut back further.\nOn November 10, the issue of ODA resurfaced again. After sending various fact-finding missions into China in August, a group of Upper House lawmakers in the Diet, or parliament, said it no longer saw any need to boost ODA for China. Citing the strong anti-Japanese sentiment shown during the Asian Cup soccer tournament held in China in August, the report compiled by the supra-partisan group pointed out that Japan's ODA for China may have been invisible to the Chinese public. It also noted that many Japanese taxpayers feel uneasy about their money being used to aid China, a nation growing into a major business rival for Japan (though China's economic demands have fueled Japan's economic recovery). The report thus called for \"gradual reductions\" in Japan's ODA for China and proposed that the government consider the possibility of ending yen loans to China altogether, a position supported by Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura.\nJapan's ODA, which consists of grants, aid and technical assistance, is funneled through multilateral agencies such as the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations and the World Bank, as well as through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Currently, Japan's US$8.9 billion annual ODA budget is 30% lower than 1997. This amount is the second-highest after the United States, which gave away $15.8 billion largely as a response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, ostensibly to sever the links between poverty and terrorism.\nIn terms of geographical spread, Japan's ODA has been very extensive. Since 1954 - the year marking Japan's participation in the Colombo Plan, which gave ODA its initial shape - Japan has provided some $221 billion in ODA to 185 nations. Nevertheless, falling tax revenues over the last decade, made worse by the bursting of the bubble economy in 1989, has reduced Japan's ODA budget along with other government expenditure by 5% in the last five years.\nThe Foreign Affairs Ministry is seriously concerned with the shrinking ODA. This is because Japan is entering an important phase in which it seeks to be a more proactive player in the world stage. Arguably, without ODA, it has been more difficult to win over various countries, say foreign ministry officials. As a senior ministry official told the Daily Yomiuri, \"Whenever Japan runs for non-permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council, it gets support from developing countries. This is a direct result of Japan's ODA.\"\nSenior bureaucrats of the Foreign Ministry in Kasumigaseki clearly value the utility of ODA despite the \"checkbook diplomacy\" criticism attached to it - an image Japan has tried hard to shed. Newly appointed Foreign Minister Machimura, for instance, cited the reunion of former abductee Hitomi Soga with her family in July in Jakarta as a successful product of ODA. This is because Indonesia, a longtime ODA recipient, \"was willing to cooperate with Japan\", said Machimura. Yet the cutback is almost inevitable because of the declining tax revenue and the public pressure surrounding ODA to China.\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Cabinet Office in October 2003, 19% of the people surveyed believe Japan should continue providing active economic assistance to all countries and 26% believe the country should give as little aid as possible. The public's response is, to some extent, caused by two strategic developments that affect the impression of Japan's ODA policy, more specifically over how ODA should best be used.\nFirst, though Japan extended close to $1 billion to China in loans that year, the public has begun to question whether such loans are at all necessary since China has expanded so dramatically both economically and militarily. Hence from a peak of $2 billion that China received in 2000, the figure has now been substantially trimmed. Second, in autumn 2001, Japan also provided the US with indirect support by extending economic assistance to Pakistan, which was cooperating with US military operations against terrorism. People, both within and outside the government, have questioned the merit of this assistance and some are demanding that Japan use ODA strategically as a diplomatic tool.\nAccording to Michael Green, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, the Foreign Affairs Ministry itself introduced an ODA charter in 1991 that outlined four conditions for aid recipients: fostering peace, democracy, freedom and market economy. Of these, China has performed moderately only in a few. China's successful transition to a market economy (though many hold that it's far from complete) has not struck a positive chord with the Japanese populace either. This is because China is increasingly seen as an economic rival, in spite of a 60% improvement in Sino-Japanese trade this year, trade that is now valued at $140 billion, according to the latest study by The Economist Intelligence Unit.\nBecause of the drop in tax revenue, along with growing public pressure, the annual value of yen loans to develop railways, roads and other infrastructure in China have been halved over the past three years. Instead, the biggest ODA recipient is now India.\nMuch of the disappointment with China is evident in Japanese people bewildered by China's seeming inability to \"feel grateful\" for Japan's economic generosity. The Chinese, meanwhile, are still deeply angered over Japan's invasion and atrocities in World War II and the Rape of Nanjing in late 1937 and into 1938. According to a senior strategist at Sony, \"Japan is disappointed with China's inability to be more thankful over all these years. The historical issue has been brought up often even though Japan has done much to help China develop economically and environmentally,\" he told Asia Times Online on condition of anonymity.\nSumming up these feelings, Professor Satoshi Amako of Waseda University, a longtime China watcher, wrote in the Asahi Shimbun on September 15 that contrary to what China may think, Japan has continued to feel responsible for its well being even after China's voluntary renunciation of war reparations. Amako pointed out that Japan's ODA involvement with China began with the construction of Shanghai Baoshan Steel Works, which symbolized reforms and opening up of China in the early 1980s. In the 1990s, Japanese ODA was also used for China's infrastructure development and energy projects.\nBetween 1996 and 1998 alone, up to $2.25 billion was spent on China's energy projects, with another $3.27 billion committed to environmental and other projects. Over the past six years, the use of ODA for environmental initiatives has become a staple in Sino-Japanese cooperation. Japan has to date granted loans to China totaling about US$30 billion.\nYet Sino-Japanese problems refuse to go away, especially exacerbated by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's yearly visits to the Yasukuni Shrine to Japan's war dead, including Class A war criminals. Complaints about China's mismanagement of Japan's ODA have not abated either. Last month, Foreign Minister Machimura claimed that \"China is not taking sufficient measures to protect the environment ... If things continue as they are, polluted air and acid rain will keep coming over to Japan.\"\nJapan's ODA policy is now at a turning point because aid given to China is increasingly growing controversial at home. The Foreign Affairs Ministry clearly sees China as a \"liability\" insofar as ODA is concerned. In view of the overall shrinking ODA and Japan's need to win over other friends and allies with \"checkbook diplomacy\", it is inevitable that funds flowing to China are set for further downsizing.\nPhar Kim Beng is a regular contributor to Asia Times Online.

The Foreign Ministry's 2004 white paper on ODA boasts that Japan, now one of the world's largest ODA providers, has made major contributions to the economic development and the improvement of welfare in developing countries. It says Japanese ODA has contributed to the phenomenal economic expansion of East Asian countries through the improvement of infrastructure and development of human resources. In 2003, however, Japan's actual ODA spending posted the fourth year-on-year decline. In 2001, Japan was replaced by the United States as the top ODA provider. In the coming years, it could be overtaken by France, Germany and Italy in the ODA rankings. The white paper notes that the general account budget for ODA in 2004 fell 30 percent from 1997, while the defense budget decreased 1 percent and the public-works budget declined 9 percent. The ODA cutback has reflected Japan's huge budget deficit, one of the largest among industrial countries. With the outlook bleak for eliminating the deficit, the government budget inevitably places more importance on domestic requirements than on foreign needs. The big question is how to restructure ODA in response to changing economic situations at home and abroad. First, Japanese ODA should now be focused on Africa and other non-Asian regions. Asia, which has received 50 to 60 percent of the aid, has achieved fast economic growth. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which seeks to conclude a free-trade agreement with Japan, is moving to expand trade and reduce its dependence on ODA in hopes of achieving economic independence. Although ASEAN is urging Japan to lift import tariffs on rice, sugar, bananas and other farm produce, Japan's farm ministry resists doing so to protect domestic farmers. There are fears that Japan could use ODA to placate ASEAN countries' demand to lift tariffs. The Foreign Ministry should permit corporate entities to acquire farmland and take other measures to expedite the restructuring of agriculture and the liberalization of farm-produce imports. Second, Japan should strictly observe the principles of its ODA charter by suspending or reducing aid to countries that contravene them. China clearly flouts the principles as it is increasing military expenditures and has produced weapons of mass destruction and missiles. China's ongoing persecution of followers of Falun Gong, a spiritual practice combining exercises and meditation, contravenes another charter principle, which calls for protection of basic human rights and freedoms. In recent years, Japanese ODA to China has been decreasing amid mounting public criticism, but in actual spending for 2003, China still was the second-largest recipient after Indonesia. China has the world's second-largest foreign-currency reserves after Japan, and provides ODA to other developing countries. China should decline further ODA. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's attitude toward China is perplexing. He has angered Beijing by continuing his visits to Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's war dead (including class-A war criminals). Meanwhile, anti-Japanese sentiment is strong among the Chinese, as evidenced by the reaction of Chinese spectators to Japan's national team at an Asian Cup soccer game in August. China reacted coolly when Koizumi announced Japan's intent to seek permanent membership on the U.N. Security Council last month. The situation indicates that Japanese ODA to China has become a complete waste. The ODA charter lists Central Asia as one of the important target regions for assisting democratization programs and market reforms. This is fine except for the large amount of aid being given to Kazakstan, the region's richest country with oil, nonferrous metals and other resources. The Kazak ambassador to Japan, with whom I met recently, said the country needs more direct investment from the Japanese private sector than yen-based loans from the government. I doubt whether Japanese aid is based on careful studies of the target region. Third, the white paper says the government has been enhancing dialogue and cooperation with, and increasing aid to, nongovernmental organizations, but the efforts leave much to be desired. In 2002, subsidies to NGOs accounted for only 1.5 percent of Japanese ODA, far below 12.9 percent for the Netherlands, 12.1 percent for Ireland and 8.2 percent for Canada. Michiya Kumaoka, president of the Japan International Volunteer Center, says European governments and NGOs tend to work as partners, but in Japan, the government totally controls ODA. NGOs in Japan are only subcontractors for the Foreign Ministry. In his opinion, the ministry should attach more importance to ODA-based projects worked out by NGOs. The Foreign Ministry should make better use of NGOs to make up for the shortage of ODA staff, which is much smaller than in other countries, and to improve aid plans from citizens' viewpoints. I am seriously concerned about the Japanese government's tendency to use huge amounts of tax money as reconstruction aid for Afghanistan and Iraq after blindly supporting the U.S.-led war on terror. This gives the impression that Japan is serving U.S. foreign policy, thus raising doubts about the integrity and humanitarian nature of Japanese aid and causing erosion in the trust of Japanese NGOs. More caution is needed concerning Japan's aid policy. Kiroku Hanai, a former editorial writer for a vernacular newspaper, writes on a wide range of issues, including international relations.

Both chains would survive, but several hundred stand-alone Kmarts throughout the country are expected to be transformed into Sears stores. The goal: A quick kick-start to sales away from Sears traditional base of shopping malls.\nLampert and Sears chairman and CEO Alan Lacy, in announcing the deal on Wednesday, promised up to $500 million a year in savings within three years from store conversions, back-office job cuts, more efficient buying of goods and possible store closings.\nShares of both Kmart and Sears, Roebuck and Co. surged on the news, but some analysts are skeptical that it amounts to a home run.\n\"Both have been broken in some sense,\" said Dan Hess, president and chief executive of Merchant Forecast, a New York-based independent research company. \"Kmart has to learn to survive in a Wal-Mart world and Sears needs to learn to survive in a world of Home Depot and Lowe's.\"\nLampert, 42, was as an assistant to Robert Rubin at Goldman Sachs & Co. before leaving to form a hedge fund at the age of 25. He orchestrated the deal and will lead a new board that will be dominated by Kmart directors.\n\"We need to have a low-cost structure to compete with bigger retailers,\" said Lampert, whose Greenwich, Conn.-based investment firm controls Kmart and is Sears largest individual shareholder, with a 15.8 percent stake.\nFor Sears, the merger allows the company to move more quickly to where it believes its strongest base of customers are. \"Off mall is where we need to move very aggressively,\" said Lacy, who will become vice chairman and chief executive of Sears Holding.\nLacy said he and Lampert have known each other for four years. The idea for a combined company first arose when they were in talks about Sears' purchase of 50 Kmart stores earlier this year, he said.\nThe new company is expected to have $55 billion in annual revenues and 3,500 outlets. That will mean it will trail only Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc. among the biggest U.S. retailers.\nIt will be headquartered in the northwestern Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, where Sears has its headquarters, but will maintain a \"significant presence\" in Troy, Mich., where Kmart is based.\nThe deal marks a remarkable comeback for Kmart, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early 2002, leading to the closing of about 600 stores, termination of 57,000 Kmart employees and cancellation of company stock.\nLampert gained control of Kmart when the retailer emerged from bankruptcy in May 2003 through the conversion of his debt holdings into equity. In March, Kmart posted its first profitable quarter in three years.\nWhile same-store sales have continued to decline, Lampert has maximized cash flow in part by selling off some of the stores to Sears and Home Depot.\nOn Wednesday, Kmart said it earned $553 million, or $5.45 per share, in the third quarter ended Oct. 27, compared with a loss of $23 million, or 26 cents per share, for the same period a year ago. Its stock price has risen more than sevenfold from $15 a share when it emerged from bankruptcy.\nSears' roots date to the late 1800s when it offered merchandise by mail order to farmers, opened its first retail store in 1925 and eventually became the nation's biggest department store operator.\nMired in a retail slump, Sears had long fallen out of favor on Wall Street after losing ground to competitors and enduring sluggish sales for years. The company last fall introduced its Sears Grand stores, which offer grocery and convenience items besides traditional Sears fare such as clothing, home appliances and tools. The concept had delivered promising results for the retailer at its first three stores in metropolitan Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and in the Chicago suburb of Gurnee.\nLampert said the goal for the combined company is to achieve a 10 percent operating profit margin, a level that's generated by such retailers as Gap Inc. and Target Inc. But he noted that in the meantime, the financial operations will be \"lumpy\" as it digests the two companies.\nA key part of increasing productivity at the stores will be in the cross selling of the brands, though company officials declined to be specific on which they would overlap. Besides Craftsman tools and Kenmore appliances, Sears' exclusive brands include Lands' End clothing. Kmart's brands include Martha Stewart, Jaclyn Smith and Joe Boxer. Lampert said that Sears could also benefit from Kmart's expertise in its pharmaceutical department and health and beauty products.\nLampert said that it is unlikely any Sears stores would be converted to Kmarts and that store closings are a possibility. \"I think we'll probably end up over time opening more stores than we close, but obviously if we don't operate the stores well, it might be the other way around,\" he said.\nHe also would not provide any details on possible layoffs, except to say, \"There will be some head count changes that come out of this.\"\nSears shares soared $7.70, or 17 percent, to $52,90 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange and Kmart shares climbed $7.33, or 7 percent, to $108.55 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nShares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. also rose 6 percent on the belief among investors that the deal could bring a larger-scale merchandising agreement with Sears. Currently, Martha Stewart Everyday brand is sold exclusively at Kmart in the United States, and at Sears Canada.\nUnder Wednesday's agreement, which was unanimously approved by both companies' boards of directors, Kmart shareholders would receive one share of new Sears Holdings stock for each Kmart share. Sears shareholders can choose $50 in cash or half a share of Sears Holdings stock. That portion of the deal values Sears shares at $11 billion, a 10.6 percent premium over its value at Tuesday's close.\nThe merger, expected to close by the end of March 2005, is subject to approval by Kmart and Sears shareholders, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.\nSears Holding also created the office of the chairmanship, which consists of Lampert, Lacy and Aylwin B. Lewis, who was named president of Sears Holding Corp., CEO of Sears Retail. Last month, Lewis, formerly an executive at restaurant operator Yum Brands Inc., was named chief executive and president of Kmart.\n'); //--> Loading Top Headlines...\nSubscriptions >", "title": "Kmart Acquires Sears in $11 Billion Deal", "url": "http://www.forbes.com/business/services/feeds/ap/2004/11/17/ap1662284.html", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041119063644/http://www.forbes.com/business/services/feeds/ap/2004/11/17/ap1662284.html"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "advertisement\nKmart Buying Sears in $11.5 Billion Deal\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Discount retailer Kmart Holding Corp.

QUICK VOTE What do you expect from the Kmart-Sears merger?\nLower prices\nMore Martha Stewart, Lands' End stuff\nLots of store closings\nNothing, Wal-Mart rules!\nView results The deal, announced Wednesday morning, will create the third-largest retailer in the country. The new company, known as Sears Holdings, will be based at Sears headquarters outside Chicago. While the new company will operate both Sears and Kmart stores, \"several hundred\" Kmarts will be converted to Sears, Sears Chairman Alan Lacy said at a news conference. The companies currently operate about 3,500 stores combined. \"Sears has had a very different problem from Kmart,\" Lacy said. \"Our service and products are as good as our competitors but they're not where our customers are. This now gives us the opportunity to grow off-mall locations closer to the customer.\" Kmart, founded as S.S. Kresge in Detroit in 1899, has long been strong in clothing and home accessories, and in recent years has added brands such as Thalia Sodi, Jaclyn Smith, Joe Boxer and Martha Stewart Everyday products. Sears, which started selling watches through catalogs in 1886, later became best known for its Craftsman tools and Kenmore appliances. And while it's struggled in clothing and other soft lines, it bought Lands' End and developed youth-oriented Apostrophe brand to try to fill those holes. For consumers, the deal means being able to get appliances and other hard goods at Kmart and more clothing at Sears -- and could mean lower prices as the two chains try to compete. \"Imagine going into Kmart and buying a Sears Craftsman tool set, or buying Kmart's Martha Stewart home products at Sears,\" said Marshal Cohen, chief retail analyst with market research firm NPD Group. \"To Kmart shoppers, Lands' End may not mean anything, but now it will.\" \"We don't want two separate cultures but to blend it into one great culture.\" Kmart Chairman Edward Lampert said Thursday. \"The idea is to make the stores more competitive while staying focused on the customer.\" From meager beginnings, Kmart and Sears both grew quickly to dominate the retail landscape after World War II. Then along came Wal-Mart and other big discounters like Target, newer chains that changed the face of retailing in America. Andy Serwer takes a closer look at the $11 billion merger of two American retail icons.\nPlay video\n(Real or Windows Media) Ali Velshi reports on what the deal means for investors.\nPlay video\n(Real or Windows Media) \"It's not so much that Sears and Kmart did anything wrong, it's just that they didn't change while the rest of the industry was changing around them,\" said Barbara Kahn, professor of marketing at the Wharton School. \"Sears and Kmart did not differentiate themselves from the competition. Wal-Mart came along with its great service and low-prices, other retailers started to innovate more with products and service. Sears and Kmart simply trudged along and thought that was good enough,\" she said. Retail analyst Kurt Barnard said Kmart's low prices and Sears reputation for service should make a good fit. But he and other analysts said the combined company will still face stiff competition, and that store closings were likely. \"One [name] will probably fade out of existence,\" Barnard said, adding, \"Don't be so sure that Sears is the one that survives. Kmart is a discount store name and perhaps more able to compete with Wal-Mart on that basis than Sears.\" The merger should help the new company compete against Wal-Mart (Research), the world's largest retailer, as well as Home Depot (Research), the home improvement chain, and Target (Research), which will lose its place as No. 3 to the combined Sears-Kmart. On Wall Street, investors applauded the deal, sending Sears (up $7.79 to $52.99, Research) stock up 22 percent while Kmart jumped 16 percent in afternoon trading. (Click here to read more about the man behind the deal) The complex cash-and-stock deal is worth about $11 billion, the companies said. (For more on what the deal means to investors, click here.) The companies said they expect cost savings and additional sales of $500 million a year after the merger is completed. It's subject to approval by shareholders and regulators. (For key facts about the deal, click here.) Moving too slowly? Sears has been too slow to expand away from mall locations, industry analysts said. \"If there are indeed hundreds of Kmart conversions into Sears, the company will dramatically accelerate its off-mall presence, a category which has been its downfall,\" said Lois Huff, retail analyst with Retail Forward. Sears opened a new store concept, Sears Grand, last year in a bid to battle back against Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy, which have moved rapidly into free-standing stores in cities and suburbia. \"The benefits to Sears consumers is more product choice and shopping convenience. Kmart's apparel brands like Joe Boxer and Thalia Sodi have lower starting price points, so consumers could see some downward movement in prices in the apparel category.\" said Huff. \"The Kmart stores that continue to exist will be the ones that Sears passed on,\" she said, adding, \"If the company keeps them, they could be converted into value stores in the same category as Dollar General.\" Industry consultant George Whalin went a step further, saying the merger could signal the end of the Kmart name. \"This is more a real estate deal than anything else. I would be very surprised if Kmart doesn't completely go away in the two to three years, or become something completely different,\" he said. -- With CNN/Money Senior Writer Chris Isidore", "title": "Kmart, Sears to merge in $11B deal", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2004/11/17/news/fortune500/sears_kmart/index.htm?cnn=yes", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041210024031/http://money.cnn.com/2004/11/17/news/fortune500/sears_kmart/index.htm?cnn=yes"}]}

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei met Tuesday morning with Japanese Ambassador Koreshige Anami in Beijing and apologized for the sub intrusion, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda told reporters in Tokyo. According to Hosoda, the vice minister did not give details of the \"technical errors,\" which the minister said took place during \"the process of normal training.\" The vice minister called the incident \"regrettable,\" a remark Tokyo interprets as an apology, Hosoda said. The Defense Agency will study if \"technical errors\" could lead a nuclear-powered submarine into the narrow channel between islands, Hosoda added. The sub, while running submerged, strayed Nov. 10 into Japanese waters near Ishigaki Island, roughly 400 km southwest of Okinawa Island. Japan initially refrained from directly blaming China. But on Friday, it started publicly criticizing Beijing and demanded an apology for the intrusion after confirming the sub was heading for Chinese territorial waters in the East China Sea.

While the LDP would leave the war-renouncing stipulations in the current Constitution unchanged, the panel proposes allowing Japan to have a \"minimum military capability\" to exercise the right to individual and collective defense, they said. The panel said the military force would be able to make international contributions when it is difficult to solve problems through peaceful measures. According to the outline, Japanese nationals would be obliged to protect the independence and security of the nation but would not be subject to a military draft, the sources said. The prime minister would be authorized to declare an emergency to defend the country, maintain security and deal with natural disasters. In these cases, the military would be dispatched and people's basic human rights would be restricted. Under the government's current interpretation of the Constitution, Japan is forbidden from exercising the right to collective defense and the Emperor is just a symbol of the state. Besides proposing that the Emperor be head of state, the panel allows for a female member of the Imperial family to ascend the throne.

Agency officials speculated that the Chinese military was trying to use the brief trespass Wednesday to show off its sea power. They said it was probably an attempt to intimidate Japan and help Beijing's efforts to secure greater resources in the East China Sea, as well as to keep in check the U.S. forces that watch over Taiwan. Military experts have said the Chinese military, which long has been largely reliant on ground forces, has been throwing its efforts behind the modernization of its navy since the late 1990s. But agency officials are puzzled as to why the Chinese Navy, which has been expanding its activities on the high seas in recent years, chose to act in a way that was certain to invoke strong anger from Tokyo. The sub did not appear to be hiding; it was navigating in shallow waters of 300 meters and was apparently an old Han-class nuclear-powered sub, known to be noisier than newer models. They said the Maritime Self-Defense Force found it relatively easy to track. \"It is obvious from the sub's movements that it was challenging the MSDF's capabilities. But we can't be sure of China's real intentions unless we ask,\" one agency official said. The MSDF this year has spotted an increasing number of Chinese scientific research ships and military vessels operating inside Japan's economic exclusive zone in the East China Sea. From January through Wednesday, patrols sighted 10 navy vessels and 16 research ships. In 2003, it said it found seven research vessels and one submarine. Beijing and Tokyo agreed in 2001 to give each other advance notice when their research ships plan to navigate within their respective EEZs. But China has continued to send its vessels without any notice, insisting that the economic zone boundaries that Japan has set are invalid. Defense Agency officials said they consider Wednesday's intrusion a sign that the Chinese military has gone one step further because the sub -- the first sighted in the area this year -- moved into Japan's territorial waters.

Vice Defense Minister Takemasa Moriya said of the submarine, \"It is navigating at an extremely slow speed and is not necessarily moving in one direction.\" He said it is highly possible the sub is nuclear-powered because it has spent a long time submerged. Only the United States, Russia and China have nuclear-powered subs in waters around Japan, he said. A senior Foreign Ministry official said Japan must consider the political implications of the vessel's nationality. \"The Japan-China relationship is at a sensitive stage,\" he said, even though the sub has not yet been formally identified.

With a fully loaded displacement of 5000 tons, this class is armed with six 533mm torpedoe tubes. All five units of this class were deployed with the North Sea Fleet, and according to some reports they were homeported at Lushan.\nThe Han-class SSNs are noted for problems, including high internal radiation levels and an inability to fire missiles while submerged, which compromise their operational effectiveness and their wartime utility against ASW-competent adversaries. The lead boats (401 & 402?) suffered radiation problems which were thought to have been solved after extensive refit. But since the late 1990s they appeared to have become inoperational. According to some reports, as of 2000 only two of its Han-class SSNs remained operational, despite the extended re-fits to the units of this class.\nFrom 403 onwards the hull was extended 8 meters aft of the sail. These three boats were erroneously reported to have been lengthened to accommodate tubes for six YJ-1 SSM launchers to the rear of the sail. The upgraded design was thought by some sources to include the ability to launch YJ-8 SSMs from the 533mm torpedo tube, but this capability has not been demonstrated in practice.\nOver the course of a three-day encounter that began on 27 October 1994 about 100 km west of Kyushu, Japan, a Han-class submarine shadowed the USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63) battle group in the Sea of Japan.

But these days, the always ebullient Detroit native seems pretty bullish on the Internet, too. MONEY, SOFTWARE FOR FOCUS: HOPE Detroit's Focus: HOPE has received a grant of $50,000 in cash and $1.4 million worth of software from Microsoft that is to be used for continuing computer training for local residents. The donation is part of the software giant's Unlimited Potential program, which aims at increasing access to technology skills training in underserved communities. The grant is to be announced today during a visit to Focus: HOPE's center on Oakman Boulevard in Detroit by Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. Microsoft has previously donated more than $3.4 million in cash and software to Focus: HOPE, one of 260 nonprofits around the country supported by the Unlimited Potential program. Focus: HOPE's Information Technologies Center offers programs that train students to support and manage office computer systems. More than 500 students have graduated since the center opened in 1999. Ballmer is in Detroit today, calling on big customers at General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler . It's a high-profile part of the effort by the software giant to listen to its customers and to use what it hears to become an even stronger force in shaping the future of the Net. \"The Internet, particularly for software companies, is revolutionary,\" Ballmer told me Wednesday, a few minutes before speaking to an executive forum sponsored by Michigan State University's Eli Broad College of Business. \"Every day, we have millions of people visit our Web site, and every day, I can tell you what's on their mind. If we just listen to them, we will succeed.\" In his talk to the Broad forum, held at MSU's Management Education Center in Troy, the 48-year-old CEO outlined what he calls Microsoft's Customer Focused Innovation, a philosophy that involves lessons learned online or by responding to the public's cyberhabits. And although the talk -- accompanied, of course, by a PowerPoint presentation -- was geared at corporate types, his visit comes amid a whirlwind of recent Microsoft activity directed at the Internet. It's reminiscent of 1996, when Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates ordered the company to do an immediate U-turn and make everything it does revolve around the Net. In our conversation, he made it clear that Microsoft has big new designs on the Net. So far this fall, Microsoft has launched a music download service aimed at competing with Apple's wildly successful iTunes Music Store, a new search engine hoping to steal clicks from Google and -- today -- a new service called MSN Spaces that hopes to capitalize on the year's most popular online trend, blogging. \"Blogging is huge,\" he said. \"It brings together the three biggest Internet trends: communicating, sharing and socializing. It started with e-mail and instant messaging and music sharing, and it's getting bigger each day.\" MSN Spaces (http://spaces .msn.com) is a part of the upgraded Microsoft Messenger 7.0 instant messenger program to be rolled out in several phases, the first of which became available after midnight today. It's a free tool that allows users to quickly and easily set up a blog, those popular combinations of diaries and online journals that people use to communicate their opinions, attitudes and activities. But the Internet has also been one of Microsoft's biggest problems. Leaky software that's been notoriously vulnerable to attacks by worms and computer viruses has brought widespread criticism of the company and calls by some in business to switch to other operating systems, like Linux. Ballmer, 11th-richest American on the Forbes list with a personal wealth of $12.6 billion (Gates is first with $48 billion), says Microsoft is listening to customers about their Web problems. \"Do we have to do better?\" Ballmer asked rhetorically. \"Absolutely. But we are constantly improving.\" At the top is everyone's list is spam. That's true even for Gates, who Ballmer says gets about 4 million pieces of e-mail -- most of it junk -- every year. (Ballmer said he misspoke a few days back when he was quoted as saying Gates gets 4 million e-mails a day.) Ballmer says only about 10 junk e-mails make it into his e-mail inbox each day because of anti-spam technology the company has developed. \"I would say that 80 percent of your Free Press readers get more spam than they need to,\" he said. \"Existing technology built into our products and others is capable right now of filtering it out. Why we haven't been able to get people to do so, I haven't figured out yet.\" Microsoft is proposing a new Internet standard called Sender ID that verifies the domain name from which the mail is sent by checking the origin of e-mail against the purported owner of the sending domain. Last month, Microsoft got a major boost when America Online, the nation's largest Internet provider, reversed an earlier decision and endorsed the concept. Ballmer also sees digital music continuing to be dominant. While he grudgingly calls the best-selling Apple iPod \"a nice device,\" he predicted that standalone music players will be obsolete in five years, replaced by mobile phones that have much more powerful MP3 players built in. \"The thing about technology is it always is changing,\" he said. \"Customers want convenience, and the trend will be getting everything in one device.\" Contact MIKE WENDLAND at 313-222-8861 or mwendland@freepress.com.\nRelated stories > MIKE WENDLAND: Directory could bring unwanted calls MIKE WENDLAND: Little hard drive handles big load -- and it's fast Computer crook and others are grabbing laptops Today's picks and clicks TECH BUZZ: Miniaturization \u0097 Chip contains a supercomputer", "title": "MIKE WENDLAND: Ballmer talks up links to the Net", "url": "http://www.freep.com/money/tech/mwendland2e_20041202.htm", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041207045952/http://www.freep.com/money/tech/mwendland2e_20041202.htm"}]}

The new MSN Search is designed to reduce the time and effort required by consumers to find information online by offering one of the largest, most up-to-date selections of information and a new class of powerful, customizable search tools. The global beta version of MSN Search is available today for public use in the United States at http://beta.search.msn.com, and worldwide in 26 markets and 11 languages from local MSN Web sites.* The new MSN Search allows consumers to quickly receive relevant answers from a universe of more than 5 billion Web documents. New and innovative features in MSN Search provide an enhanced search experience by providing relevant answers to direct questions -- such as \"What is the second-longest coastline in the world?\" -- within the search results. In addition, the Search Near Me feature automatically provides information and resources that are close to home, dramatically reducing the time needed to find geographically relevant information and eliminating the need to sift through thousands of links. Finally, searching for news, images or music is fully integrated into the new, streamlined search experience. \"The release of our beta is a huge step toward delivering the information consumers are looking for online, faster than previous versions of MSN Search,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president for the MSN Information Services & Merchant Platform division at Microsoft Corp. \"With better results and more powerful search tools, MSN Search is creating a new, higher standard for online search -- one that helps consumers find the information they need, when they need it.\" New Search Engine Revs Up Relevance and Presentation of Online Answers At the heart of the new MSN Search is an advanced search engine, built over the past two years on Microsoft\u00ae technology, that dramatically improves search results by offering consumers the following features and benefits: Vast index of information.

New Search Tools Offer Consumers More Control Microsoft designed MSN Search to overcome the one-size-fits-all approach offered by other search engines. Pull-down menus and other customization tools built into MSN Search allow consumers to control and refine their searches in the following ways: Search Near Me. Consumers can receive search results tailored to a geographic location. A consumer in Portland, Maine, who needs to know the location of the nearest local fire station no longer needs to sift through online listings for Portland, Ore. This is accomplished by assigning geographical information to Web pages as they are indexed by the service.\nConsumers can receive search results tailored to a geographic location.

This is accomplished by assigning geographical information to Web pages as they are indexed by the service. Search Builder. MSN Search users can customize search results by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain search criteria, such as specific sites or domains, countries, regions, or languages. Consumers who want to apply specific criteria to their searches can visit a menu of adjustable on-screen dials for each criterion. The dials can be reset when consumers' criteria change. A consumer who needs current facts and figures can adjust the dial to emphasize the most updated results, and someone looking for the official Web site of a favorite television show can adjust the dial to emphasize the most popular results. Through the efforts of many of its top developers and employees around the world, Microsoft is dedicating thousands of hours to build the new search service, a complete version of which is slated to launch early next year. The new MSN Search is another example of the MSN vision to empower people globally through information, software and services that help them find, discover and experience what they want to online.

The new MSN Search is designed to reduce the time and effort required by consumers to find information online by offering one of the largest, most up-to-date selections of information and a new class of powerful, customizable search tools. The global beta version of MSN Search is available today for public use in the United States at http://beta.search.msn.com, and worldwide in 26 markets and 11 languages from local MSN Web sites.* The new MSN Search allows consumers to quickly receive relevant answers from a universe of more than 5 billion Web documents. New and innovative features in MSN Search provide an enhanced search experience by providing relevant answers to direct questions -- such as \"What is the second-longest coastline in the world?\" -- within the search results. In addition, the Search Near Me feature automatically provides information and resources that are close to home, dramatically reducing the time needed to find geographically relevant information and eliminating the need to sift through thousands of links. Finally, searching for news, images or music is fully integrated into the new, streamlined search experience. \"The release of our beta is a huge step toward delivering the information consumers are looking for online, faster than previous versions of MSN Search,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president for the MSN Information Services & Merchant Platform division at Microsoft Corp. \"With better results and more powerful search tools, MSN Search is creating a new, higher standard for online search -- one that helps consumers find the information they need, when they need it.\" New Search Engine Revs Up Relevance and Presentation of Online Answers At the heart of the new MSN Search is an advanced search engine, built over the past two years on Microsoft\u00ae technology, that dramatically improves search results by offering consumers the following features and benefits: Vast index of information. The MSN Search index of more than 5 billion Web documents is one of the largest indexes offered today. With more items being added continually, the new search engine increases consumers' chances of finding the information they want.\nThe MSN Search index of more than 5 billion Web documents is one of the largest indexes offered today.

Direct answers. Users can ask the search engine a question -- such as \"What is the capital of Turkey?\" -- and receive the answer -- \"Ankara\" -- from Microsoft Encarta\u00ae, the No. 1 best-selling encyclopedia brand.** Authoritative, direct answers are provided in a number of categories, including definitions, facts, calculations, conversions and solutions to equations.\nUsers can ask the search engine a question -- such as \"What is the capital of Turkey?\" -- and receive the answer -- \"Ankara\" -- from Microsoft Encarta\u00ae, the No. 1 best-selling encyclopedia brand.** Authoritative, direct answers are provided in a number of categories, including definitions, facts, calculations, conversions and solutions to equations. Direct actions. When consumers type the name of an artist, song or album, they get linked directly to top music and other content provided by MSN Music. One click allows MSN Search users to sample music, and a second click lets them purchase and download it.\nWhen consumers type the name of an artist, song or album, they get linked directly to top music and other content provided by MSN Music. One click allows MSN Search users to sample music, and a second click lets them purchase and download it. Content-specific searching. To help consumers quickly get to the information they are looking for, MSN Search enables them to search for specific information using search tabs such as Web, news and images. New Search Tools Offer Consumers More Control Microsoft designed MSN Search to overcome the one-size-fits-all approach offered by other search engines. Pull-down menus and other customization tools built into MSN Search allow consumers to control and refine their searches in the following ways: Search Near Me. Consumers can receive search results tailored to a geographic location. A consumer in Portland, Maine, who needs to know the location of the nearest local fire station no longer needs to sift through online listings for Portland, Ore. This is accomplished by assigning geographical information to Web pages as they are indexed by the service.\nConsumers can receive search results tailored to a geographic location. A consumer in Portland, Maine, who needs to know the location of the nearest local fire station no longer needs to sift through online listings for Portland, Ore. This is accomplished by assigning geographical information to Web pages as they are indexed by the service. Search Builder. MSN Search users can customize search results by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain search criteria, such as specific sites or domains, countries, regions, or languages. Consumers who want to apply specific criteria to their searches can visit a menu of adjustable on-screen dials for each criterion. The dials can be reset when consumers' criteria change. A consumer who needs current facts and figures can adjust the dial to emphasize the most updated results, and someone looking for the official Web site of a favorite television show can adjust the dial to emphasize the most popular results. Through the efforts of many of its top developers and employees around the world, Microsoft is dedicating thousands of hours to build the new search service, a complete version of which is slated to launch early next year. The new MSN Search is another example of the MSN vision to empower people globally through information, software and services that help them find, discover and experience what they want to online.

As expected, the company on Friday announced a new road map for Longhorn, its revision to Windows XP. The changes - removing some features and altering others - are designed to let the company have a test version of the software next year and a final release for desktops and notebooks by 2006. A server release is planned for 2007. \"In order to make this date [of 2006], we've had to simplify some things, to stagger it. One of the things we're staggering is the Windows storage work,\" Jim Allchin, Microsoft's vice president in charge of Windows development, said in an interview with silicon.com sister site CNET News.com. \"We\u2019ll still have rapid search covering the data just as we planned.\" Microsoft's top executives had characterised Longhorn as a major overhaul of the operating system and stressed that its release would not be determined by trying to hit a specific ship date. However, as the project threatened to push out into 2007 or beyond, analysts argued that the software maker needed to scale the project back to something more manageable. The software maker has not had a full release of its desktop operating system since Windows XP debuted in October 2001, although the company has shipped specialised versions of the operating system, such as the Tablet PC and Media Center editions. Microsoft has also been faced with a strain on its programming resources for Longhorn, with much of the Windows development team commandeered to complete the Service Pack 2 security update to Windows XP, which Microsoft finished earlier this month. Longhorn was originally supposed to have three major changes: a new file system, WinFS; a new graphics and presentation engine known as Avalon; and Indigo, a web services and communication architecture. Microsoft is making changes to all three pillars. WinFS will be available as a beta when the Longhorn release comes out as a client. Avalon and Indigo will be part of Longhorn, but also made available separately for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. By making Avalon and Indigo work on older machines, Microsoft hopes more developers will want to write software that takes advantage of the new technologies. Had they been Longhorn-only features, the concern is that developers would have held off writing software until there was a critical mass of machines running that operating system. \"Getting 'Longhorn' to customers in 2006 will provide important advances in performance, security and reliability, and will help accelerate the creation of exciting new applications by developers across the industry,\" Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, said Friday. The changes come, Microsoft executives say, following months of conversations with computer makers, developers and customers. Computer makers were said to be pushing Microsoft for a release that would not take until 2007 to deliver. Doing that, Allchin said, meant taking WinFS out of Longhorn. The company now believes it can more fully implement the new storage concept and do so simultaneously for both servers and desktop computers, something that would not have been possible had WinFS been part of Longhorn. The move clouds Gates' long-time vision for a unified storage system, something he has called a \"holy grail\". Such a system would allow people to easily group all kinds of documents by various categories, such as who created or edited them. Improved search, across multiple kinds of files, will still be a key feature of the revamped Longhorn, Microsoft said.", "title": "Microsoft reveals latest on Longhorn release", "url": "http://software.silicon.com/os/0,39024651,39123578,00.htm", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20050113233745/http://software.silicon.com/os/0,39024651,39123578,00.htm"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Remarks by Bill Gates, Chairman and Chief Software Architect, Microsoft Corporation\nIT Forum 2004\nCopenhagen, Denmark\nNovember 16, 2004 BILL GATES: Good morning. It is very exciting to be here and to talk about the great advances taking place in hardware and software. Microsoft\u2019s role is to provide a software platform that allows everyone who is building applications to build far more powerful applications. It was very inspiring to hear from the doctor about the Rolltalk application and the difference it has made in his life. Stories like that remind me that we are in the most interesting field that there is. The pace of innovation is as fast today as ever; the opportunities for great advances are clearer than any in the past. First, let me talk about the hardware foundation that we build on. We have had the benefit of exponential improvement in recent decades. Moore\u2019s Law was a prediction that we would see [a] doubling in performance every two years and, in fact, the microprocessor industry has done even better than that. Performance is something that we almost take for granted at this point. Particularly in the first half of next year, as we move from 32-bit to 64-bit systems, we will have a very smooth transition, with total binary compatibility. This will provide the ability to mix 32-bit and 64-bit; a very simple recompilation for any application that you might want to run, using the full 64-bit address base. This will really bring us to the frontier of computer performance, whether single-system performance or the ability to group together many systems in a scale out type approach. Even the most expensive mainframe will not deliver the performance that industry standard hardware running Windows will deliver. That is a wonderful milestone for us, no longer requiring people to buy expensive systems simply to achieve the best possible performance. Hardware Innovation However, the processor has not been the only place that has provided new opportunities for software innovation: the advances in network speeds, where, within a corporate network, we can assume even a gigabyte type performance; the availability of wireless Wi Fi in most places where business is done, and in Wide Area Networks; and the advance in storage capacity, with costs coming down even faster than Moore\u2019s Law type improvement, allowing us now to think of document and image libraries that would have been impractical in the past. We are very excited to see the pace of adoption of these technologies: new graphics chips for better visualization; larger screens, moving up to 17-inch, 19-inch or multi PAL type LCD displays; and RFID for tagging information and having it available to track. I think it is fair to say, therefore, that hardware is in no way holding us back. Broadband We would like to see broadband adoption increase even more quickly. Some countries have moved ahead on that; nevertheless, over the next five years, in all developed countries, the majority of people will be connecting through broadband and interacting with information through many devices: PCs at work and at home, portable PCs, Tablet PCs, and pocket devices such as the phone, evolving from simply a voice device to a data device. Having all these devices work very well together and be secure and up to date are very significant challenges. R&D; Not only are advances taking place in hardware, but also in software. In terms of Office, we are taking the idea of meeting or document sharing or business intelligence, and bringing them to a new level. Investment in R&D; by us and our partners is at a record level; we alone have spent over $6 billion in R&D;, which is applied primarily to the Windows platform, and to Office. Interestingly, however, we see the piece of improvement in usage being somewhat faster in the consumer space, with developments in photography, web searches and music, and advances in gaming applications, being at their highest ever pace. In the business space, which is our biggest focus, there are some great breakthroughs: the acceptance of XML as a standard, and the acceptance of the Web-service protocols for connecting applications \u2013 Exchange and XML data. Those promise finally to allow any piece of software running on any system to connect to any other piece of software. The sorts of things we are doing in Office will bring an entirely new level of Office productivity, breaking down the boundaries of distance and different organizations. However, we still find that the pace of adopting these improvements is not as fast in the business space, and there are several reasons for this. First, there is a need to make the environment easy to secure. Second, there is a need to make it not nearly as complex. Let us focus here on complexity, which is really the theme of my comments: how we can take software and use its magic to eliminate much of this complexity. The fact is that this is exactly what software is for. Many of the manual things involved in setting up systems and monitoring them can be eliminated; many of the efforts involved in trying to work out how to map your workload on to different systems can be done in a very automatic way. Simplifying IT through Software We have set a very ambitious goal for ourselves in terms of software simplifying IT; not just one aspect of lifecycle, but bringing all the different elements together, and making it so that, when you develop an application, you can put in information about how that application should run and the resources it requires. This makes it easy to bind that application into the operations environment, and for information workers to see the state of transactions and how well the applications are running. It also makes it easy to think in terms of high level model diagrams, and check to see what is happening, not only with the systems, but with the business processes themselves. Historically, development, operations and business analysis have been different worlds. We have not had the ability to express, in a high level form, the things that would connect all of those together. It is through these high level models that are built on top of the web service standards that we can really change the world of IT complexity. It think this is not only a very exciting thing, but also very necessary. After all, historically, most IT budgets made room for innovation, because hardware and communications prices came down. Although that has continued, those have become a small enough percentage that, in order to make room for great innovation such as new applications, new processes and Tablet PCs, or the ability to understand customers better, and to track and forecast in a better way, we have to take a lot of the IT costs so that we can free up budget for the new world. That means eliminating complexity. Of course, software is the magic element here; having software that models system resources and applications needs, and makes it far simpler to take advantage of the hardware resources that are available. Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) and Virtual Server 2005 We have a few things that are very focused on this, and which are being announced today. In particular, we have our MOM (Microsoft Operations Manager) 2005, which is our key management software \u2013 a major new version of which is available today. We also have our Virtual Server product. This is the first time we have made this capability available. Over a year ago, we bought a company that worked in this area called Connectix, and began to study what our customers wanted in terms of being able to break workloads down and use different system resources in a very dynamic way. In order to provide this, we created the Virtual Server product. These products enter a vision of the IT lifecycle and the simplification that people expect, making it possible to no longer think in terms of individual systems that are brought together through labor, but to have MOM provide an integrated view of what is happening on all these different systems. There is a big embrace of standards here: management standards that have been advancing in a very exciting way; the new methodology of using remote capabilities and web service protocols to connect all these things together; and a belief we can make things far more automatic. In order to understand why we are so excited about this, we should take a look at these products in action. I will now ask Bill Anderson, group product manager at our Windows and Enterprise Management Division, to give us a quick look at the new products. BILL ANDERSON: I would like to show you that, once again, we have painted Copenhagen with a brush of manageability. Last year, we launched Systems Management Server (SMS) 2003 at our worldwide launch event here, and this year we have an opportunity to launch MOM 2005 and Virtual Server 2005. I would like to take a few minutes to show you some of the things that you can see in MOM 2005, and to walk you through a scenario where using these technologies together could help you solve some real business needs. The user interface is the first change that you will notice, with a very task based approach. We have found that, with an Outlook basis, it makes it simple and easy for an administrator to navigate quickly through tasks. The second thing you will notice is the word \"state.\" You are probably very experienced at managing many distributed enterprise. We want to take those distributed enterprises and enable you to think of them based on roles and on health. By using the \"state\" view, we can do that; we can simply and easily display the health of the system and its distributed applications so that you can really understand the situation at a single glance. Through the interface, it is possible to drill down into details on that item. I can view the typical alerts that I am used to being able to manage. However, the real power of tools like MOM is the ability to encapsulate knowledge within the application. Down below, under Alert Details, it provides some base level descriptions; however, if I expand the Product Knowledge tab, it allows me to see detail that has been embedded inside the shipping product. For example, this is the Exchange Management pack; the data that has been built by our program managers in the Exchange team tells you best how to use this particular technology. If I scroll down, it even has things such as Suggested Registry Configuration. You probably have your own standard operating procedures that you follow when you see an alert such as this, so you can encapsulate all of that as well. It stores knowledge \u2013 both ours and yours \u2013 through this process, on an end to end basis. I would now like to talk about using MOM and Virtual Server to solve a business problem that you face on a day to day basis, and we will look at a server consolidation scenario. We will use MOM as a preparatory tool to understand which servers should be consolidated, and we will use MOM plus Virtual Server to do this consolidation. I will firstly open up my MOM reports; I have created some customer reports in MOM, which is something that all of you do. It is very extensible and the data is very open. In this case, I have a report called \"candidates for virtualization.\" I have taken a group of servers from some of my geographies, and have consumed things such as CPU usage and memory utilization. I then look at them on a simple grid to understand which servers are underutilized, and which are over utilized. As you can tell, my Florida servers seem to be quite underutilized, so they become a good candidate to be consolidated; in this way, I can reduce the cost of software management going forward. I am now going to return to the MOM console and select a geography; in this case, it is my North American East Coast region. I will show you another new piece with MOM, which is the diagram view. It allows me to render its topology of my distributed services, and not only to show them topologically, but to show the relationships between the two. I have my two geographies exhibited here. The last thing we want to be able to do is to take actionable data from MOM and execute on it. In this case, we have created a Task view as well, where we have embedded some base tasks and you can extend your own in the Task pane view. I am going to select one of these servers and virtualize it for a consolidation scenario. I will go to my Virtual Server tasks, and choose Migrate Physical Server Virtual Machine. When I begin this process, it is using some of the scripting that was released in Virtual Server Migration Toolkit (VSMT), also available this week, to remotely virtualize this process. Normally, for server consolidation, you would send a team of technicians across your distributed geography, which is a very costly process. Now, by using MOM 2005 as a task launch pad type of element, using the scripting in the VSMT, and then being able to use Virtual Server as a consolidation tool, you have the ability to do this kind of virtualization remotely, without having to incur travel or operational costs. In a normal server, this would take 30 45 minutes to execute. For the sake of condensing this for today\u2019s demonstration, we have run the automated process but have not wrapped any services to bring back. It is running through the process, but we are not pulling a Web service or directory service to come back. The task has now just completed and has brought that server back into the Virtual Server environment, and it is rebooting the Virtual Server for me. I will now go back and look at where we left this by refreshing my diagram view. You will see that the topology updates for me. Not only is going to update the topology that I have in place, but it will show me the new relationship between these virtual sessions that I have just moved across, and across the virtual host session there, because of the management packs that are in place today. Hopefully, by using technologies like MOM and Virtual Server, you will be able to manage your software and hardware more efficiently and more cost effectively. Thank you. Automated Processes BILL GATES: Let me talk about another element of complexity in managing an IT environment, which is keeping software up to date. The importance of this has really been highlighted by the security issues over the last few years. Many system updates are critical in nature; that is, the need to reach the systems that run the software before some malicious code exploits some aspect of that system. There is no reason why the update should not propagate faster than the malicious code; we simply need to have the infrastructure and the right classification. Updates come in many different categories; in most cases, it is necessary to take time to install an update on your network. If it is a new version of the application, you may want to synchronize that with some other work that you are doing. You may want one group of users to have it first and use that as a pilot, before you roll it out to other people. Every aspect of software updating should be very automated. You should be able to do it sitting at a central console, not only setting up the commands, but also being able to track exactly what is happening. Microsoft has been in the business of providing these capabilities through our SMS product for many years. SMS 2003 has been a great success; the majority of our enterprise customers now use this to carry out deployment, representing over 16,000 companies connected to more than 10 million different devices. We also have a version of SMS for smaller customers, simply connecting their systems very directly to the updates that we provide. We call that Windows Update Services, and that is going into public data today. Its successor will be called SUS and will be quite advanced, meeting the needs of small and many medium sized organizations. For SMS, we have two very important additions; these are new capabilities that we have called feature packs, which are fully supported add ons. The Device Management Feature Pack enables you to connect and manage things like Pocket PCs, Smartphones and other Windows CE type devices. The OS Deployment Feature Pack, installed in the same framework as you manage software updates, enables you to manage operating-system updates and firmware updates. All these things can be brought together and synchronized in a very simple fashion. As I have talked to customers about SMS over the past year, I would say that the OS Deployment pack has been what they have most frequently requested. We think this is one of the processes that, for the IT department, have been fairly high overhead. Even with the high overhead that people have had in software updating, they have not been able to achieve the degree of compliance and the speed of updating that they want to achieve. Therefore, with the magic of software, we think we can make dramatic headway in both of those areas, in terms of reducing the time involved and achieving update compliance, so that you literally sit at a console and pick the timeframe that you want, insisting that the systems have those updates. The area of agile software delivery is something that we believe we are turning into reality. I would like Bill Anderson to return and show you a demonstration, which I think is the best demonstration ever done of any management related software. This is our Zero-Touch Provision. BILL ANDERSON: Today, we announced the OS Deployment Feature Pack and the Device Management Feature Pack for SMS. These will be available to you for download today, so we are really excited about that. As we start thinking about OS Deployment, SMS has always been a great preparatory tool, but it has lacked that one piece \u2013 the ability to deliver an image to an existing machine, which is what we are delivering to market today. When we think about OS Deployment, we think about two different core scenarios. One is a user self provisioning scenario, where you may have a group of users who are very empowered, or users who have very inconvenient schedules, or users where a topdown \"everyone installed at once\" approach does not work. For other scenarios, you may want to be able to take a group of 100 or 1,000 machines and provision them in an automated way. We will walk through both of those scenarios today. In the first one, I am an empowered user working in a local bank called Woodgrove Bank. This is my work PC; I am also running an NT4 workstation. My administrator has given me the ability to do the upgrade in my own timeframe. Because we use e-mail so frequently, my administrator has sent me a simple e-mail, indicating that I have already been approved to do this upgrade. He has given me some details, so I understand that I am going to submit something that will take a couple of minutes, and that the process will actually take 30 45 minutes. He has also given me the link to a SharePoint portal site, which we use to provide a lot of services to different employees in our organization. This is based on your business logic and business rules. There is a list of different services; today, we are most focused on \"upgrade my computer.\" I select Upgrade My Computer, which goes to Active Directory, and it makes note of machines that I would have the ability to upgrade. By selecting my client machine, it will also prompt me that it will move me to XP SP2. By choosing \u2018next\", it gives me more information. Because this is a longer process for a user, we want to make sure that they are very well informed of the processes they are going through. At this point in time, I submit my request. I have already been pre approved for this, but, in a large, complex organization, you may need a tier of administration to include a pending approval process. It might be somebody working in purchasing or procurement, to ensure that you own the software, or an administrator, to ensure that your 486 could really run XP SP2 if you chose to do so. However, since I have been pre approved, in a couple of minutes\u2026 [BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT] \u2026 structures will come back to me. This would actually kick this process off. My state and data would be preserved and my machine would be upgraded. That is the first scenario. However, a lot of you have a lot of machines that you want to be able to take care of, and hundreds or thousands of PCs that you want to be able to migrate. We thought about how we could simulate hundreds or thousands of PCs for you to be able to migrate over the course of this demonstration. We thought that we might take the Connectix or the show\u2019s .NET and simply flatten it and rebuild it completely during the course of my keynote speech. For those of you who know Mr Cheeseman[?], that did not go over very well. Therefore, Andrew decided that he wanted to encourage us to choose a different path. Hence, we have chosen something a little simpler and easier to do that, it is to be hoped, really draws the message across for you. If you take a look at the right hand side of the auditorium towards the front, you will actually see a curtain pulling back. Back there we have 100 PCs that are currently set up running Windows 2000 and Windows XP Service Pack 1. Those PCs have a little user data and a little user state. You can notice that they have different color bitmaps. The goal of the bitmap is for you to understand that we are actually migrating state as part of the overall process. During the course of the keynote speech, our goal is to back up the user state and data, flatten those devices, bring them back up to Windows XP SP2, restore user state and data and conclude all of that in the course of eight to 10 minutes or so. That is what we are going to try and do. The goal for SMS\u2019s OS Deployment Feature Pack is to make sure that it is very tightly integrated with what you do with SMS today. Let me show you just how easy it is to set it up inside of SMS. For those of you who are familiar with the SMS user interface, you will notice that the simple Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in and we create a package and a program just like any other piece of SMS software. This allows you to do this particular set of tasks, without having to re skill your administrators. As this is integrated with SMS, you get the scalability, reliability and hierarchical nature that you are used to using to move these pieces around. It is a simple program that we have created. One of the things that is interesting about OS deployment is that it has some unique qualities to it for customization. It has things such as licensing that has to be customized and Windows configurations and network configurations that many of you spend a lot of time with scripts to customize today. We have nested those inside the user interface so that we can automate that for you, so that you do not need to be script geniuses. This will solve about 80 to 90 percent of the needs you have for OS deployment right there. For those of you who have some advanced needs that you need to get through, we have built it in a modular way so that you can use simple scripting, whether it be Visual Basic Scripting (VBS), batch files and so on, nested in each of the modular components that are there. Enough about that; I want to light the wall on fire. For the sake of the demonstration, you would normally schedule this for midnight or whatever the time is for your particular users. As you can imagine, we probably are not prescriptive enough to know that at 10.52 a.m. we wanted that to go ahead and kick off. Therefore, what we have done is that we have kicked off the [?] SMS and it is just waiting for a set of instructions from me before it goes. Say a prayer to the demonstration gods, as there is no backup for this one. I am going to execute this script. You notice automatically that it has already kicked those systems off. There are a couple of other color patterns for you to note; the Windows 2000 machines are the red and the blue bitmaps, the XP machines are the yellow and green bitmaps. The first process it kicked off was state migration. Notice the systems that are actually running faster. Therefore, that is again another reason to think about XP. What we are doing is that we are backing up state, re imaging these machines remotely, not touching them and we are going to be able to do this in about eight to 10 minutes. You will say, \"Oh, my gosh.\" Allow me to give you one caveat. We are not doing the significant number of applications that you would normally do in your enterprise and we are not doing gigabytes of data as you would typically back up and restore for your enterprise customers. That is how we get it into 10 minutes instead of 30 or 40 minutes. Either way, the goal is that with the technologies we just shipped today, you have all the tools are your disposal to be able to migrate hundreds and thousands of PCs at a really low operational cost. Thanks again, Bill. Watch the wall. BILL GATES: We had the challenge to be able to do this automatically laid down before us several years ago. Therefore, it is fun to be here and see it actually working with shipping projects. That is a real milestone. I want to give you one example of a customer who is using our updating infrastructure, as well as our management infrastructure to deal with a very complex scenario. The customer is the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) in Switzerland. They are a challenging case because they have 156 embassies and consulates spread all over the world. Of course, they have quite a wide variation in network activity to those different locations, including cases where the network may go down for a period of time and then come back up later. Therefore, you have to be very smart about how you use the network bandwidth and be able to track and let them know exactly what has and has not been done. They have over 3,000 PCs and 500 servers worldwide. We sat down with them and went through the idea of moving towards a single domain, which was a great simplification. They had one in each of the embassies and therefore about 150 went down to one. We then went through building this foundation that they can track and update their entire environment. Hence, the savings that they were able to identify were worth over $1 million a year and yet the quality of what they are able to achieve with this new approach is actually higher than with the previous approach. I think it is a good example of how the magic of software really can step in and deal with some of the complexity that we have here. Identity Management Let me now talk about another significant source of IT complexity, dealing with identity management. As we have looked at our customer environments, they have a lot of applications that relate to identity, for example the payroll applications and the file system permissions. All the different systems they have provide different user interface and different approaches for group identity and individual user privileges. Often, this complexity shows through to the end user effectiveness, forcing them to remember different passwords or waiting until things have been brought into compliance. Hence, as a new employee or as somebody whose privileges have changed, it is not very immediate for them to get that put into effect. Also now, we have a lot of cases where people are trying to break into identity systems. The term given to this is \"phishing.\" Over 50 million people have received fraudulent mail that attempts, by using Web sites that look legitimate, to have you come in and provide credit card numbers and things of that nature. If we have the identity system set up properly, we should be able to authenticate exactly which sites you want to give that information to and prevent those fishing people from ever being successful. We also have, from many companies including, probably, everyone here, the need to follow the new privacy directive. That means really looking at what information we have on different systems, bringing that information together and making sure that it is very secure. This has become extra important. For many IT systems, we have Active Directory. Active Directory has been very successful. The majority of our customers have deployed the latest Active Directory and most of the rest of them are in the process of doing that. It is a key foundational piece. We have an update that comes next year to the Windows Server called R2, which has some significant updates to the Active Directory capabilities. We have talked about the Web single sign on and federated identity as being two substantial advances that come with that Windows Server release. Those are things that people have been asking about in order for these scenarios to work across different organizations. We also believe in connecting Active Directory to these identity systems, and we call that our Identity Integration Server. That is where we can read and write information to, for example, HR systems and other directory systems. We can connect up to UNIX directories, NetWare directories and over 20 different systems. We believe that the idea of having a layer there that connects the information between the different identity systems is very important. Although today it is only a few thousand customers who are using this meta directory approach, we believe that we can bring that into the mainstream and make that very practical for people and show it to be a solution that reduces the complexity they have in dealing with the identity systems. Another major issue for identity systems is, of course, the weakness of the password. Passwords have been the primary way that people identify who they are. Unfortunately, for the type of critical information on these systems and the regulations that ask that these systems be secure, whether it is health data, financial data or customer access to customer records where only certain people should have that information, we are not going to be able to simply rely on passwords. Therefore, moving to biometric identification and particularly in moving to smart cards, is a way that is coming. This is something that has been talked about for several years, but now we finally see the leading edge customers taking that step. We have many partners that are helping to push this forward. One of the key elements for us is to have a smart card that really connects up in the best possible way to the Microsoft platform. Therefore, I am announcing today a .NET based smart card. We have a key partner here, Axalto. They have done a super job on this. In fact, Microsoft itself will be using their smart cards internally and in all of our access to our premises. Each employee will have a smart card and will use the same smart card to get in and out of the buildings as we use to connect up to our machines. Therefore, we are requiring smart card use for any remote connections to our systems. Over time, we will completely replace passwords, where even the internal access will be done through this smart card. By having the .NET capability there, we think that allows you to bring different logic and different information down onto the card itself, using the same development tools used for everything else. Hence, we have a richness and a continuity there to the platform that only exists in that .NET environment. We are very excited to see our smart cards moving into the mainstream and connecting up to our infrastructure. Dynamic Systems Initiative Let me talk about our overall framework for how all of these IT activities can be connected together. The broad term we use for this is the Dynamic Systems Initiative (DSI), which is our phrase for moving away from thinking about individual systems and manual activities. This vision of software doing very strong resource allocation is a vision shared across the industry. In fact, we recently had a great advance in the submission of web services management protocols that we and partners like Intel and Dell submitted to become the web services standards around this type of dynamic management, which means modeling systems and applications. DSI has both system and applications descriptions. In order to do this well, we need to bring in all the different parts of the IT lifecycle, including developers, analysts and operations people who need to be connected. To do this really well, it has to be built into the development and modeling tools; in our case, Visual Studio. The 2005 release of Visual Studio, which is in a beta stage right now and should be finalized around the middle of next year, is a significant step towards having made DSI a strong reality. We believe that this is a software problem; this is a very important set of things to do. It requires strong work with partners, and we are very proud of what we are doing there. All of these tools fit under the DSI initiative. DSI is the common description language that will let all of these things connect together. That is what will get us to the ultimate level of efficiency in these things coming together. I mentioned the importance of partnership, which spans our entire management space: working with the hardware companies and the applications providers to make sure that the pieces really fit together. I would say a very important partner, if not our most important partner, in doing this is Dell. We are very excited about some joint initiatives that we are taking with Dell. Michael Dell has some comments about the partnership; let us hear from the Chairman of Dell. [VIDEO] MICHAEL DELL: Bill, thanks for the great introduction and for inviting me to be a part of your keynote at IT Forum. Microsoft\u2019s focus on systems management and solving our customers\u2019 most challenging data centre issues is shared at Dell. In fact, the Development Partnership for Change Management that Kevin Rollins and Steve Ballmer announced yesterday will send a life raft to customers who have been manually updating their servers every day and a wake-up call to the industry to focus on customer centered product development. We are just getting started. The IT Forum is an important opportunity for customers to learn about new solutions for management that are in development and to share your vision of the perfect data centre with us. At Dell, our vision for the data center is one built around industry-standard building blocks. It is a vision we call the Scalable Enterprise. Our goal is to simplify your operations, improve utilization, and cost effectively allow you to scale today while building a path to the future. Microsoft\u2019s vision, the Dynamic Systems Initiative, complements the Scalable Enterprise with an excellent set of solutions to help customers manage standard based servers, storage and networks in distributed environments. Dell and Microsoft have taken an innovative customer centric approach to systems management by delivering the first hardware change management solution that leverages existing OS applications. You will have fewer management tools, resulting in lower administrative costs. We are doing this by providing our OpenManage 4 source code to Microsoft so that it can be directly integrated into Microsoft SMS and MOM. Dell and Microsoft customers will be the only ones in the world to have one tool, one process to apply operating system patches, application updates, and server software. We are calling this the \"One Click\" experience. As we look to the future, our strategies are aligned to achieve these goals, and we have teams working on the next phases. We know that together we can truly enable the data centre of the future. Thank you, and enjoy the conference. BILL GATES: As Michael said, what we are doing with the partnership in terms of using the new SMS Feature Pack to deliver even the hardware upgrades is a first. It really fits into the theme of using the magic of software to reduce complexity. We have a number of other initiatives that we are doing with Dell along those same lines. Dell and Microsoft have reached an agreement for Dell to distribute a version of MOM that we call the Workgroup Edition. Starting early next year, that product, aimed at medium sized customers, will be available as a Dell offering. We have also announced a partnership with a company called Vintela that helps us extend SMS to manage not only Windows systems, but also UNIX and Linux environments. People with mixed operating systems can still look to SMS and MOM as the overall umbrella solution to provide one simple way to make sure that they take care of their updating needs. We have a broad relationship with Intel, including allowing our sales support and infrastructure to work with those products - an investment by Microsoft and Intel \u2013 so that those companies can work together. From the largest partners, the category which Dell fits into, to software vendors like Vintela, we feel the pieces are coming together very strongly to deliver on this vision, the dynamic systems initiative. One thing that often interests customers is how we take all this information and see it in a rich, straightforward way. Obviously, we build into our management tools many different ways of looking at information, so the common views are going to be right there. But for having the greatest flexibility, for being able to take the full power of our reporting server and have it operate against all management events and data logs out there, we have this idea of the system center. It connects up to SMS and MOM, and it gives you the ultimate flexibility in visualizing exactly what is going on. We think this is a great way to do performance modeling, to look into where the different bottlenecks are. The ability to mine the data, because it is on a SQL-reporting server infrastructure, it is a very powerful environment. We have a view that will take this system centered concept even further, to provide very tight integration so that for the whole lifecycle of development, design and analysis, people can sit in the system center and have the data warehouse connect up and look for our desired performance state, and what is going on with that. There is a lot of rich modeling and performance analysis capability that will be built in. You can think of this as a key application, almost like financial management is for the business group. This is a key application for the IT group. It lets them get at everything going on, and understand it in a very deep way. For our third and final demo, I will ask Bill to show us a good example of what we mean by intelligent management in capacity planning.\nBILL ANDERSON: I want to look through a couple of things that we will be doing in the next 12-24 months in the areas of integrating our data, and moving the needle forward in the area of capacity planning and modeling. Bill mentioned the system center reporting server, which will be available in the first half of next year. I want to walk you through a couple of examples of where reports, by integrating change, config, operation and performance data, can help you solve some key business problems. Often, you will spend a lot of time doing proactive performance management, but if a change was injected into your system, it would be very difficult to understand whether it had an impact on your ongoing performance. By taking this integrated data, we can have a look at that. I have a performance comparison report that will allow me look at changes executed across my server infrastructure, and will be able to correlate that against performance measures. At the top, you see software changes. These are advertisements from SMS 2003. In this case, these are different patches and updates delivered to our servers thus far. But it is also able to track my performance results in the same window. I do not see anything inconsistent with the early changes. I might see a spike from an interruption of service, possibly, but looking on or around November 8 or 9, you can see that my performance has flat-lined on me. This looks like it is some form of problem. By moving back up to the software changes, I can visually correlate, and see that my performance problem occurred on x date. You can see a \"Vulnerability in Authenticode\" error at the bottom. It seems to have been applied somewhere in the same area. I would never simply assume that that was the problem at this point, but it can reduce dramatically the amount of time spent troubleshooting the problem, and getting to the real root cause. With the ability to integrate operational performance and changing config data, I can start understanding what my systems can do for me. We will take a look at an example with Exchange. We have another report on the reporting server that allows me to look at my Exchange traffic, specifically the messages per second, by day, that are running through my exchange infrastructure. The report at the top is something you can generate from MOM today. But the real power is being able to look at this data, and in the same lens be able to look below and see each server, and understand the inventory of those servers from SMS. You can then put the two together and say, \"This one seems to be performing because it has the right horsepower, the right processor, the right memory, the right disk and spindle speeds.\" Capacity planning is a problem that a lot of you probably spend a significant amount of time on. We think reporting server will be good, for a start. But there is some other work we are doing through Microsoft Research that will, we hope, move the needle even farther. There is a project we are working on, codenamed \"Indy,\" which is based at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, U.K. It is really a set of deep analytics around performance variables inside hardware. The project\u2019s goal is the ability to consume a model. Bill mentioned standard models, and the ability to show what an application should behave with. Being able to use that model, take that data, and provide prescriptive architecture to give you the guidance necessary to deploy, is what Indy will allow us to do. What I have is a simple exchange diagram for my corporation: a single server in Europe, a couple in Asia, and four in the States. What I have done through \"Indy\" is enter manually the number of users at locations, and some of their e-mail behaviors. What \"Indy\" has done is give me this prescriptive architecture, showing me the topology I should have. However, most sizing tools will stop there. But \"Indy\" allows us to run a simulation against this topology, and let me look in depth at the bottlenecks there. I will simulate the model against this topology, and it will come back for each of my servers and their key roles. It will show me the performance counters and utilization in each one of those elements: CPU, NIC, RAID; all the different pieces crucial to our sizing and capacity planning. As I scroll through, I see nothing outside of the norm. It looks like a topology that will probably work for me. I do not know about your business, but ours is quite fluid. Often, we are creating business partnerships, mergers, acquisitions, constantly changing our business and our business variables. One thing that \"Indy\" will also allow us to do is to make a change, represcribe the architecture, and resimulate the model. So, not only is it a one time snapshot, but it can also be used as an ongoing tool. I will change the parameters now. Instead of 400 employees in Europe, let us say we have 2,000. I will now simulate the new architecture that is there. By doing these analytics, it says that topology-wise, we need to increase our capacity inside Europe. That is what we think, anyway. But let us simulate the model again. It will simulate that model and its use cases against the existing topology it proposed, and reverify that the hardware and software performances levels are at the capacity needed. We hope that through this modeling technology and prescriptive architecture, our management tools like SMS and MOM, and the system centre line consuming this data, we can give you all the necessary details to run your business economically. Microsoft Product Roadmap BILL GATES: We have great belief in this modeling approach. That is where we can save a dramatic amount of cost, and let you really plan ahead, and have far more reliable systems. The models can let you do things like capacity planning. I want to spend a few minutes on the roadmap for Microsoft products coming out this year. [BREAK IN TRANSCRIPTION] And next year, and then in the \"Longhorn\" wave, from the top in 2006. There are a lot of exciting things happening. The theme we have struck today is about using software to reduce complexity; that is a very big theme for us. In parallel with that, we are taking things and providing new and rich capabilities. We are ushering in the wave of development tools that provide the web services approach. People talk about that as the service orientated architecture; I believe that that is the greatest change to how developments are designed that has taken place over the last decade. It is really a dream come true in terms of the flexibility that it provides. It is really necessary to allow integration within your enterprise and across enterprise boundaries. Without this architecture, the full realization of e commerce effectiveness would never have taken place. It is fantastic that the industry has really come together around the Web services standards. Whether it is Microsoft, IBM, Intel or many other companies, the standards are being laid down there, to work across systems of all types. This year we made the announcements for Virtual Server and MOM 2005. We also have BizTalk 2004, our ISA Server update and our Host Integration Server update. Quite a few things have been happening in the last part of 2004. Next year is a very big year; it sees the arrival of 64-bit. As I have said, that is a really huge thing. As we have been going through the benchmark numbers of Windows Terminal Server, or of the new version of SQL working out of environment[?]; the ability to cache more data in the memory makes a huge difference for the performance critical applications. This is not a case where you are going to have to think, \"OK, let\u2019s use 32-bit systems where we want inexpensive hardware and use 64-bit systems where we want expensive hardware.\" The work that Intel and AMD do at the chip level means that these 64-bit capabilities are going to come into your servers with no premium in price. The same type of pricing with the servers that you have today will be available with 64-bit capability. We are actually in the final stages of testing of the 64-bit version of Windows. In fact, internally in Microsoft, we are running a lot of applications already on 64bit Windows. Our Microsoft treasury department does our portfolio analysis using 64-bit Windows. All of the work we are doing in the Search base, where we have literally thousands of servers building a capability that we think will go beyond what others like Google have done in the past, is being built on our 64-bit Windows. That is a very strong foundation. We have a Server update; Release 2 (R2) comes late next year. In the middle of the year, we have Visual Studio and the database update; SQL Server 2005, codenamed \"Whidbey\" and \"Yukon.\" Those are a very big deal, with modeling coming in and Web services arriving in a rich way. There is another BizTalk update, a System Center update, a Commerce update and the Host Integration Update; quite a bit, therefore, in 2005. I would actually say, though, that in some ways 2006 is an even more important year, as this is where the advances under the codename \"Longhorn\" are coming out. We have a new client, where manageability and security have been made the top priorities. We have new development capabilities with the presentation advances in \"Avalon,\" the runtime package for Web services that we call \"Indigo\" and the rich file system \u2013 which goes way beyond the traditional file system \u2013 bringing together the benefits of file system and database, designed around XML constructs, and called \"WinFS.\" All of that becomes available to developers and users during 2006. It is a very strong roadmap; a reflection of the substantial increase in R&D; investment that we are making. It is really a response to what ISVs are interested in us delivering, so that they can focus on their solution work and rely on the platform to do a lot of work that they have had to do in the past, and then address the needs of end users and IT. Looking ahead, our optimism about how software can improve is stronger than ever. Some of the breakthroughs like speech and ink, and the modeling based approach that we have talked about today, require many years of R&D;, feedback and improvement. No doubt, however, there will come a point where, just like graphics interface, we will take those things for granted, and we will have big business benefits coming from those things. All of these technologies need to relate to customer value; where they see new applications and where they see their IT budget going. Therefore that is why I say that innovation is not just about new applications, but also about driving a level of simplicity that can open up those opportunities. There are big breakthroughs ahead. We appreciate your support; it has been great to see the attendance here at this conference, which has been a record for us. This is a great opportunity to continue the dialogue about exactly what we should do with R&D; to allow you to meet your goals. It is great to be here and thank you very much.", "title": "Bill Gates' Web Site", "url": "http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2004/11-16ITForum.asp", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041127003640/http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2004/11-16ITForum.asp"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "The conference is now over.\nA comprehensive post-conference DVD containing final conference slides, speaker notes, session information, third party information and more, was mailed to all delegates on Friday 13th December.\nTo receive more information about Microsoft IT Forum 2003 and other Microsoft European Events, click here\n*10 November is for pre-conference sessions and registration", "title": "Microsoft IT Forum 2002", "url": "http://www.microsoft.com/europe/msitforum/", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20030202202211/http://www.microsoft.com/europe/msitforum/"}]}

The videotape shows a group of marines on Saturday entering a mosque in Falluja, where several wounded Iraqi prisoners lay on the floor. One marine is shown shooting and apparently killing one Iraqis. The marines were members of the Third Battalion, First Regiment, with whom Mr. Sites was embedded. An unedited version of the videotape, which was distributed to other news agencies as part of a pool report, was being broadcast several times an hour on Arab satellite television stations on Wednesday, and American commanders have said it has already yielded a huge propaganda victory for the anti-American insurgency.\nSource:\nRobert F. Worth, The New York Times In Arab media, video of Marine dominates all\nINTERNATIONAL The chilling video of a U.S. Marine shooting and killing a wounded and apparently unarmed man in a mosque in Iraq dominated the Arab world's media Wednesday, overshadowing the slaying of a British aid worker who had been kidnapped by Iraqi insurgents. The U.S. military said it was expanding its investigation of the Marine shooting in Fallujah to look into whether other wounded men in the mosque were also shot and killed. The probe will try to determine whether the Marine acted in self-defense. The shooting was played and replayed in Arab media, debated and portrayed as \"evidence\" of what many Arabs believe: that the United States is destroying Iraq and Iraqis. Frames of the Fallujah shooting appeared on many newspaper front pages Wednesday and Arab satellite stations repeatedly aired the footage taken by an American television crew.\nSource:\nSam F.

The U.S. military said it was not aware of any such detention. Citing another Al Arabiya correspondent as its source, the group said the Arabic satellite station lost contact with Abdel Kader Saadi, a reporter and photographer living and working in the Sunni Muslim city, on Nov. 11. U.S. forces launched a massive assault on Fallouja last week. U.S. artillery was still pounding the city Wednesday as troops hunted remaining guerrillas, days after Washington said its offensive had ended rebel control. The committee quoted Al Arabiya as saying Saadi had been detained in a mosque along with several other civilians. He had been wearing a flak jacket with the word \"press\" on it in Arabic and English.\nSource:\nReuters Increasing dangers in Iraq make reporting the whole truth tough\nVIEWPOINT/INTERNATIONAL My 26th birthday party was perfect. \"Even a jaunt to the grocery store is a meticulously planned affair. Do you have a radio? A flak vest? A second car to watch for kidnappers?\u201d Stars glittered over the Baghdad hotel where I blew out the candles on a cake decorated by my four closest Iraqi friends. We stayed up until the dawn call to prayer rang from a nearby mosque, telling stories and debating the future of a country I'd grown to cherish. A year later, only one of those friends is still alive. The poolside patio where they sang \"Happy Birthday\" in Arabic is empty most days, because foreign guests are afraid of snipers and mortars. The hotel has become a prison, and every foray outside its fortified gates is tinged with anxiety about returning in one piece. Baghdad has never been tougher for journalists. Treacherous roads and kidnapping squads restrict travel. \"Embedding\" with the military or going with Iraqi government officials is the safest way to leave the capital. Our ability to uncover and tell the truth about Iraq - good and bad - has suffered terribly. At least 36 journalists have been killed covering this war. Everyone seems to know someone who's been taken hostage. We share our nightmares of terrorists cutting off our heads.

The goal is to avoid a repeat of what happened this Election Day, when leaked information from exit polls was posted by Internet commentators known as bloggers about 1 p.m. ET. That was minutes after the data had been given to the five television networks that, along with the Associated Press, formed a consortium to pay for exit polls and count votes during major elections. Sheldon Gawiser, chairman of the polling consortium's steering committee and NBC's director of elections, said Wednesday that in future elections, no data will be sent to the networks and AP until at least 4 p.m. ET. The \"first wave\" of data that bloggers posted this year, he said, was too raw to be valuable to \"people who don't know what they're dealing with.\" The data were supposed to be kept confidential and used only to help the networks plan their election night broadcasts. The early polls showed Sen. John Kerry leading President Bush in the race for the White House and in key states such as Florida and Ohio. By shortly after 3 p.m. ET, some television commentators were hinting that Kerry appeared likely to win.\nSource:\nMark Memmott, USA Today FCC crackdown could spread\nVIEWPOINT/REGULATION With support from both Republicans and Democrats, the Federal Communications Commission is poised to get even more aggressive about enforcing moral values throughout broadcasting, even putting cable television in its cross hairs and taking aim at Howard Stern's right to talk dirty on satellite radio. It looks like only the courts will stand in the way of the FCC now. But a funny thing could happen on the way to washing Eric Cartman's mouth out with soap: Conservative judges might just say no. After all, not too long ago the Supreme Court rejected efforts to censor the internet. \"As soon as those regulations go forward, they'll get challenged legally, and I think they'll fail,\" predicted Adam Thierer, who studies the media at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. \"But I'm not 100 percent certain.\" After rejecting 83 percent of indecency complaints received in 2002, the FCC burst out of its cocoon in January after singer Janet Jackson's \"wardrobe malfunction\" on national television. CBS eventually got socked with a $550,000 fine, and a slew of other radio and TV stations found themselves under fire. Even PBS began leaning heavily on the bleep button, and last week, several ABC stations refused to air an uncut broadcast of Saving Private Ryan for fear that the FCC would issue fines for indecency. (\"War is heck,\" said one newspaper headline.)\nSource:\nRandy Dotinga, Wired News Apologies for everything except network timidity\nVIEWPOINT/REGULATION The networks should just get it over with and run preventive apologies as crawls under all their regular programs: \"We are so sorry you just saw that/ Please forgive our producer, he lost his head for a second/Gosh, I am such an idiot I could shoot myself.\" First CBS apologized for interrupting the ending of \"CSI: NY \" with a news bulletin that Yasir Arafat had died (that was unforgivable). Now ABC has apologized for showing Nicollette Sheridan's bare back in a scripted skit introducing \"Monday Night Football.\" Unless the network was apologizing for not having allowed the actress to turn around, then the mea culpa is baffling: women's nude spines are shown on commercials for body lotion and shaving cream all the time. If viewers - and the National Football League - are so offended by the sight of an actress pretending to seduce a man while naked (her rear was not shown) - how do they get through ads for Cialis and Levitra?\nSource:\nAlessandra Stanley, The New York Times Dropping the ethical towel\nVIEWPOINT/BROADCASTING People are understandably angry that ABC Sports kicked off \"Monday Night Football\" with one of the Desperate Housewives dropping her towel in the locker room for Philadelphia Eagles star Terrell Owens. The towel, as you may have seen a few dozen times on television, was all she was wearing. (ABC execs apparently snoozed through the whole flap over celebrity boob Janet Jackson and forgot that millions of kids are watching these games.) But Washington seems to be yawning through an admittedly less sexy episode that, if it involved a Democrat, would have conservative radio hosts turning red with rage. The Republicans are saying that it's perfectly all right for Tom DeLay to continue as House majority leader if he's under indictment--leaving them vulnerable to charges of naked political manipulation.\nSource:\nHoward Kurtz, The Washington Post Bono's new casualty:\nVIEWPOINT/BROADCASTING As American soldiers were dying in Falluja, some Americans back home spent Veteran's Day mocking the very ideal our armed forces are fighting for freedom. Ludicrous as it sounds, 66 ABC affiliates revolted against their own network and refused to broadcast \"Saving Private Ryan.\" The reason: fear. Not fear of terrorism or fear of low ratings but fear that their own government would punish them for exercising freedom of speech. If the Federal Communications Commission could slap NBC after Bono used an expletive to celebrate winning a Golden Globe, then not even Steven Spielberg's celebration of World War II heroism could be immune from censorship. The American Family Association, which mobilized the mob against \"Ryan,\" was in full blaster-fax and e-mail rage. Its scrupulous investigation had found that the movie's soldiers not only invoked the Bono word 21 times but also, perhaps even more indecently, re-enacted \"graphic violence\" in the battle scenes.\nSource:\nFrank Rich, The New York Times Grand jury subpoena stands for Time magazine reporter\nLEGAL A federal judge yesterday refused to quash a subpoena seeking the testimony of Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper and ordered him to answer questions before a grand jury investigating whether Bush administration officials illegally leaked the identity of a CIA operative to the news media. Cooper's lawyers argued that the Washington-based reporter had already in August answered limited questions about his contact with one Bush administration official when interviewed by special prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald is investigating how Valerie Plame's name became known to the news media soon after her husband, former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, criticized the administration's argument for going to war in Iraq. Cooper's lawyers said Fitzgerald's demand for a second chance to question Cooper was \"unreasonable and oppressive.\" But U.S. District Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan said the focus of Fitzgerald's investigation has shifted unexpectedly since that interview and he rightly seeks to ask other questions.\nSource:\nCarol D. Leonnig, The Washington Post Kentucky station to apologize for hoax report\nRADIO A radio station owner will publicly apologize for falsely telling listeners the city had banned smoking in cars, and the city dropped plans to file a complaint with federal regulators. Cumulus Broadcasting, owner of WXZZ-FM, will appear before the Urban County Council on Thursday to apologize, offer a written assurance that the report, which prompted a torrent of angry calls, was a hoax. It will also give $1,000 to charity. Officials in the city, in the heart of tobacco country, approved a ban last year on smoking in bars, restaurants and other public places. It was upheld by the state Supreme Court in April. The bogus report that smoking in cars also was banned was aired Nov. 10, and three morning show hosts were suspended the following day. The three -- identified only by on-air names Twitch, Mary Jane and Kyle -- were back on the air Wednesday.\nSource:\nThe Associated Press via the San Francisco Chronicle R.I. reporter expects to be convicted of contempt\nLEGAL Chief U.S. District Judge Ernest C. Torres has ordered [Providenc, R.I., television reporter Jim] Taricani to disclose who leaked him a secret FBI videotape showing Frank E. Corrente, the top aide to former Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr., taking a $1,000 bribe in Operation Plunder Dome, the federal corruption probe of Providence City Hall. The three-year legal struggle -- pitting the First Amendment rights of a free press against the sanctity of the criminal-justice system -- has put Taricani in the vanguard of a wave of journalists around the country who face imprisonment for refusing to reveal their sources. The growing national attention has placed Taricani uncomfortably on the other side of the reporter's notebook. \"I'm proud to be a part of this effort with other reporters who are facing this same thing,\" he said in an interview yesterday. \"It's an effort to be able to do our job and use the tools available to us -- in this case, anonymous sources -- to bring out the truth.\" Taricani has tacked up newspaper articles about his case on the wall beside his desk, to remind himself that he is part of a broader struggle. There is also a quotation from Thomas Jefferson that Taricani said he wants to read in court when he is sentenced: \"Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.\"\nSource:\nMike Stanton, Providence Journal Newspaper Guild unsurprised by decertification at 'Morning Call'\nLABOR Newspaper Guild President Linda Foley is not surprised that the union's local at The Morning Call in Allentown, Pa., no longer exists, citing a lack of support for the bargaining unit over the years. She's also in no great hurry to try to revive it. \"If the workers decide to reorganize, we can come back,\" Foley said during a phone interview following the Guild's decision to withdraw from the 131,000-circulation paper earlier this week. \"We've never had much membership there or activity there.\" Foley's comments followed the release of a memo on Tuesday from Morning Call editor Ardith Hilliard, which informed staff that the Guild Local 38049 \"no longer has an interest in representing the newsroom employees,\" the paper reported. Hilliard did not immediately return calls seeking comment. The pullout affects about 120 newsroom employees, according to the paper, including reporters, copy editors, librarians, artists, and other editorial workers.\nSource:\nJoe Strupp, Editor & Publisher Media watchdog Reed Irvine, 82\nOBITUARY Reed Irvine, 82, the founder of a 35-year-old conservative watchdog group called Accuracy in Media, died Nov. 16 of complications from a stroke at the Casey House in Rockville. Mr. Irvine, an economist, annoyed and infuriated major media for years with his syndicated critiques, prolific letters to the editor, and confrontational questions at corporate meetings that routinely accused the press and broadcasters of a liberal bias. In vilifying the media, he was at the forefront of a conservative movement that over the next several decades evolved into a well-funded cottage industry. \"I think he was the first to really sound the trumpet of liberal bias,\" said Michael Hoyt, executive editor of Columbia Journalism Review, based at New York's Columbia University. \"I think he represented a resentment that was larger than him. Some people treated him as a kook, but others thought, 'Maybe he's got some points here.' That had a lasting impact.\"\nSource:\nPatricia Sullivan, The Washington Post\nTo get PressNotes in your inbox every week day, click here to send a subscription e-mail.\nBe sure to include your name and e-mail address in the body.", "title": "Society of Professional Journalists", "url": "http://spj.org/pressNotes.asp?ref=8642", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041225152844/http://spj.org/pressNotes.asp?ref=8642"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Press Notes Tuesday, October 30, 2001 Circulation rises at most top U.S. newspapers\nNewspapers treading lightly on ad rates\nPortland daily closes up after 13 issues\nMSNBC to make major cost cuts\nMTV to lay off 450, 8 to 9 percent of workforce\nMeredith Corp. reports 47 percent drop in earnings\nJudge refuses to unseal Oklahoma City bombing files\nMercury News sues court for document access\nRadio talk show host claims reporter\u2019s privilege\nIowa courts to charge fee for some materials\nFlorida lawmakers urge moderation in restricting records\nAuburn to stop electing newspaper editor\nArab countries may change news offerings\nCanadian broadcasters are promised relief\nDeputy Wall Street Journal editor is hospitalized\nMazzarella is named Stars and Stripes editor in chief\nDeaths: Lee, Vanett, Gantner Monday, October 29, 2001 Echo Star reaches deal to buy DirecTV\nDisney buys Fox Family Worldwide from News Corp.\nFisher Communications reveals deepening losses\nStudio scraps segment on s\u00e9ances with WTC victims\nSPJ: Anti-terrorist bill could restrict speech\nUSA Today stands by Rumsfeld headline\nNew Jersey officials pull some Web pages\nBuffalo News gets powdery letter\nU.K. to allow CNN to cover serial killer inquiry\nMalaysian police free journalist and cameramen\nPanama continues to file charges against journalists\nDominican Republic newspaper to fold\nMother fires son from SF Examiner publisher post\nDeaths: M.W.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Indiana's Ron Artest, Jermaine O'Neal and Stephen Jackson, and Detroit's Ben Wallace were suspended indefinitely by the NBA on Saturday for taking part in one of the ugliest brawls in U.S. sports history, a fight with fans that commissioner David Stern called \"shocking, repulsive and inexcusable.\" League officials and police were examining videotapes of Friday night's melee and interviewing witnesses. The NBA issued a statement saying it was reviewing rules and security procedures \"so that fans can continue to attend our games unthreatened by events such as the ones that occurred last night.\" Artest, O'Neal and Jackson -- who all threw punches at spectators in the stands or on the court at the end of the nationally televised Pacers-Pistons game -- were to begin serving their suspensions Saturday night, when Indiana hosted Orlando. Wallace's suspension will start at home Sunday night against Charlotte, the next game for the reigning NBA champion Pistons. The exact length of the four players' bans could be announced as early as Sunday. \"I didn't start it. I just played the game,\" Wallace said Saturday before learning of his suspension. \"The league is going to do whatever they feel needs to be done, and I don't have no problems with that.\" Pacers players did not immediately comment Saturday, but team CEO Donnie Walsh issued a statement saying, \"responsibility for Friday night's action can be shared by many.\" Pistons CEO Tom Wilson said the team plans to use \"playoff-level security\" starting with Sunday's game, doubling the number of armed police and increasing other arena security personnel by about 25 percent. The brawl was particularly violent, with Artest and Jackson bolting into the stands near center court and throwing punches at fans after debris was tossed at the players. Later, fans who came onto the court were punched in the face by Artest and O'Neal. \"We'll put it all together, take it to the Oakland County prosecutor's office and have them review it and they'll decide if there are any charges,\" Auburn Hills Deputy Chief Jim Mynsberge said. \"The whole fiasco could take weeks to decide,\" Oakland County Prosecutor David Gorcyca said. G. William Hunter, the executive director of the NBA Players' Association, apologized to fans for the events of Friday night. \"We are in the process of consulting with our players, league officials and others in an effort to determine all of the facts,\" Hunter said in a statement. \"No one can condone the level of incitement and violence we all witnessed.\" The next game between Indiana and Detroit is Dec. 25 at Indianapolis. The rivals, who met in the Eastern Conference finals last season, won't play each other in Auburn Hills, Mich., again until March 25. The melee was the talk of the league Saturday. Violence at NBA arenas is rare, even among the few franchises -- such as Detroit -- that draw a more rough-and-tumble crowd to courtside seats than in other cities. \"I was in total shock. Unbelievable,\" said Mike Montgomery, who oversees security at Staples Center in Los Angeles. \"You never expect something like that to happen. You prepare and train for an incident like that, but you never expect it.\" Wallace began the fracas by delivering a hard, two-handed shove to Artest after Wallace was fouled on a drive to the basket with 45.9 seconds remaining. After the fight ended, the referees called off the remainder of the game. Pacers players were pelted with drinks, popcorn and other debris as they rushed to the locker room. \"This demonstrates why our players must not enter the stands, whatever the provocation or poisonous behavior of people attending the games,\" Stern said in his statement. \"Our investigation is ongoing, and I expect it to be completed by tomorrow evening.\" The most recent example of an NBA player going into the stands and punching a fan came in February 1995, when Vernon Maxwell of the Houston Rockets pummeled a spectator in Portland. The league suspended him for 10 games and fined him $20,000. Among the harshest non-drug-related penalties in NBA history was a one-year suspension of Latrell Sprewell -- later reduced to 68 games -- for choking Golden State Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo at practice. Kermit Washington of the Los Angeles Lakers drew a 60-day (26-game) suspension in 1977 for a punch that broke the jaw of the Houston Rockets' Rudy Tomjanovich during a game, while Dennis Rodman was suspended 11 games for kicking a courtside cameraman in the groin and six games for head-butting a referee. Artest was benched for two games this month for asking Pacers coach Rick Carlisle for time off because of a busy schedule that included promoting a rap album. Artest was suspended twice by the NBA last season, once for leaving the bench during a fracas at a Pacers-Celtics playoff game; the other for elbowing Portland's Derek Anderson. During the 2002-03 season, Artest was suspended five times by the NBA and once by the Pacers for a total of 12 games. Artest also once grabbed a television camera and smashed it to the ground after a loss to the Knicks two years ago. \"People are putting all the burden on Artest, and I don't think that's fair,\" Houston coach Jeff Van Gundy said. \"He's an easy target because of all the things he's been through. But some fans have gotten to a point where they think they can do or say anything.\" Toronto coach Sam Mitchell said: \"Do I think the fans should share some of the blame? Yeah. But as professionals, as NBA players, you cannot go into the stands.\" The initial skirmish wasn't all that bad, with Artest retreating to the scorer's table and lying atop it after Wallace sent him reeling backward. But when a fan tossed a cup at Artest, he stormed into the stands, throwing punches as he climbed over seats. \"He was on top of me, pummeling me,\" fan Mike Ryan of Clarkston said. \"He asked me, 'Did you do it? I said, 'No, man. No!\"' Jackson joined Artest and threw punches at fans, who punched back. At one point, a chair was tossed into the fray. Security personnel and ushers tried to break it up. Former Pistons player Rick Mahorn, who was seated courtside as a Detroit radio analyst, also stepped in. \"After the initial encounter on the court, the players were under control. As fans quickly became involved, the situation escalated,\" Walsh said. \"More specifically, the safety of everyone present was compromised, and that is of great concern for us.\" Two of the nine people treated for injuries were taken to a hospital, police said. Detectives planned to collect and analyze video footage, interview witnesses and examine medical records. Bobcats guard Steve Smith isn't concerned about playing at the Palace on Sunday. \"Nah. No worries,\" Smith said. \"It wasn't us in Detroit.\" Copyright 2004 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He then put his plan into operation.\nEarlier that day in 1983, Vietnam veteran and priest Roy Bourgeois had walked unchallenged into Fort Benning, Georgia, wearing surplus military fatigues. He had climbed up a tree near a barracks used by Salvadoran soldiers training with the U.S. Army, waited until \"lights out,\" then unleashed his guerrilla protest.\nBourgeois turned on his electronic \"boom box\" that blared into the night air a recording of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero calling on his nation's soldiers to stop killing their countrymen. Romero was later killed while conducting Mass in San Salvador. Of the three men accused in Romero's assassination, two were graduates of the U.S. Army's School of the Americas (SOA).\nBourgeois served 18 months in a federal prison for his actions. But his protest paved the way for larger demonstrations against what some people call the \"School of Assassins\" -- but what SOA supporters say is an important tool in helping spread democratic values to Washington's allies in Central America and South America.\nThe end of World War II and the start of the Cold War ignited new concerns in the United States that Communists would attempt to infiltrate and subvert the country's southern neighbors. The U.S. Army started its School of the Americas in Panama in 1946. In 1984, under the terms of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, the school was moved to Fort Benning.\nMore than 63,000 Central and South American soldiers from 22 nations have trained at SOA since its inception. According to the school's Web site, instruction at SOA for its first several decades \"focused on nation-building skills, then [was] altered in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy to provide instruction necessary to the nations in Latin America to thwart armed communist insurgencies.\"\nOpponents of the school, who maintain their own \"School of the Americas Watch\" Web site, claim SOA graduates \"have been responsible for some of the worst human rights abuses in Latin America.\"\nSome of the more notorious individuals who have trained at SOA include:\nFormer Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, now serving an extended sentence in a U.S. prison on drug charges.\nEl Salvador's Roberto D'Aubuisson, who formed the death squads that killed Romero and thousands of others during the Salvadoran civil war.\nFormer Argentine President Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, accused of making thousands of people \"disappear\" during Argentina's \"dirty war\" of the 1970s.\nSOA officials said that out of thousands of soldiers the school has trained, only about 300 have been accused of human rights violations.\nJoe Leuer, a training specialist for course management who has worked at SOA since the early 1990s, said the connections that critics make between the school and the crimes allegedly committed by its graduates are tenuous at best.\nD'Aubuisson, for example, \"took a radio operator's course in the early 1970s. People want to connect the dots and allege the school which taught him how to operate radios efficiently also taught him how to create death squads,\" Leuer said.\nThe school insisted it was not responsible for the actions of individuals who ignored its training, which has always included instruction on the basic rules of warfare as set out in the Geneva Convention.\nThe SOA controversy intensified when a 1992 report declassified by the Pentagon in 1996 revealed the details of a manual used at SOA in the 1980s that advocated tactics such as beatings, false imprisonment, execution and bounty payments for enemy dead.\nFollowing the report, the SOA curriculum was expanded to include instruction on international humanitarian law, human rights and ethical use of force.\n\"The school has never taught torture and never will,\" SOA commandant Col. Glenn R. Weidner told a November 1998 news conference. \"We still do military training, but this is not the torture training that Father Bourgeois would have you believe.\"\nAccording to SOA's Web site, the curriculum in the late 1990s focused \"on supporting the primary foreign policy goals of the United States in the region -- consolidation of the effective democratic governance, respect for the rule of law, and economic development along free market principles.\"\nOpponents were not appeased. They wanted the school shut down. Some protests were loud, such as the ones staged every November 16 for the past 10 years outside the gates of the school. They commemorate the killings in El Salvador on that date in 1989 of six Jesuit priests, deaths to which some of the graduates of the school have been linked. Notable among the protesters in recent years has been actor Martin Sheen, star of the TV drama, \"The West Wing.\"\nOther opposition took the form of efforts in Congress to cut the budget of the school. Finally, in October 2000, Congress voted to close the school in December and reopen it in January 2001 under a new name, the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.\nArmy officials hope that changing the school's name and making sure its curriculum stresses civilian control of the military and respect for human rights will blunt some of the criticism.\nThe new school will offer courses in such topics as anti-drug operations, disaster relief and peace support -- not just to military personnel but also to law enforcement officials and civilians.\nAlthough the new law directs the school to comply with the \"democratic principles\" of the Organization of American States, opponents of the school have said the changes will only be cosmetic. They vow to continue protests.\n\"We see this as cosmetic,\" Bourgeois, a co-founder of School of the Americas Watch, said in November 2000. \"It's like taking a bottle of poison and writing 'penicillin' on it.\"\nA recent statement on the Web site of School of the Americas Watch calls on Americans to let Congress and new administration \"know that we are not fooled by this attempt to dissociate the SOA from its brutal history and from the violence that graduates continue to perpetrate on our sisters and brothers in Latin America.\"\nBut the school's defenders such as training specialist Joe Leuer say the training it provided was important in post-Cold War Central and South America.\n\"By looking at where our graduates are working now,\" Leuer said, \"on peacekeeping missions, de-mining missions, creating transparent [military] budgets, putting their military under civilian rule for the first time ... that's democratization.

SOA Watch claims some of its graduates were involved in a string of human rights abuses in the 1980s and even now exploit the people and resources of Latin America.\nAs recently as October, a former Colombian army officer who graduated from the school had been accused of murdering a state official while still a member of the military.

The numbers just keep growing every year as more people come to understand the links between the various elements of our repressive foreign policy. While the name may have changed, the mission of the SOA remains the same: to provide the training that will enable our proxies abroad to keep the rabble under the thumbs of Western business interests. The SOA/WHINSEC is an incubator for terrorism, and every American needs to know how his/her tax dollars are being invested. The Army will tell you that they can't be responsible for a few bad apples. However, you can be assured that Congress would not continue to allocate funding to any program that wasn't regularly assessed and that managed to demonstrate its efficacy. The SOA is functioning EXACTLY as it was designed to, and the tortures and murders executed by its graduates are merely a part of our wider policy of controlling democratic elements in Third World countries--what has been called \"the threat of a good example\" that might encourage other anti-capitalist grassroots movements.\nI would encourage each of you to contact your elected representatives in Washington and demand that the search for terrorists begin at home. We have a great deal of house cleaning to do before we go looking for terrorists outside our own borders.\nThanks, Chris, for the coverage. We got home last night and searched the mainstream media in vain for any mention of this phenomenal event. It seems that a couple of basketball players swapping licks with a few fans is more newsworthy than 15K people coming from all over the country to resist this cruel and inhumane tool of empire building.

Madam President, I intend to address the Senate for a period of time today. I believe I have as much as an hour under postcloture debate, but I will be discussing an issue I have been involved in for some 3 years now and have not reached a conclusion, although certainly enormous progress has been made in trying to address this issue. But during these 3 years since the appropriators slipped a $30 billion rider in the fiscal year 2002 Defense appropriations bill, a lot of strange and unusual things have happened, I am sad to say, that are a very damming commentary about the way the Pentagon in general and the Air Force in particular conducts its business. I am going to tell a story that has not, as I said, reached its end. But it has uncovered the very strong likelihood, because of the confession by Ms. Druyun in Federal court when she pled guilty, that there could be many billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money that were wasted, criminally treated, and misused because of the decisions made by Ms. Druyun. The question is, How could Ms. Druyun have done all this by herself? Did she have accomplices or was the system in the Pentagon so broken that one individual [[Page S11537]] could make contracting decisions which entailed tens of billions of dollars, and in this case may have cost the taxpayers of America millions and even billions of dollars as well? Nearly 3 years ago, behind closed doors, the Appropriations Committee slipped a $30 billion rider in the fiscal year 2002 Defense appropriations bill. This rider authorized the Air Force to lease from Boeing up to 100 767s for use as aerial refueling tankers. Before the rider appeared in the bill, Air Force leadership never came to the authorizing committees about this issue. In fact, tankers have never come up in either the President's budget or the Defense Department's unfunded priority list. The Air Force's tanker lease program was born of a virgin birth. The rider was, in fact, the result of an aggressive behind-the-scenes effort by the Boeing Corporation with considerable assistance from senior Air Force procurement official Darleen Druyun and others. After the President signed the bill into law, the Air Force embarked on negotiating with Boeing a lease that would have cost the taxpayers around $6 billion more than an outright purchase of these aircraft would have. Soon after Air Force Secretary Jim Roche submitted to the four Defense committees a report on plans to lease these tankers from Boeing, three out of the four authorizing committees summarily approved the lease without even looking at the contract. Two did so without even holding a single hearing. Much to his credit, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner held the line and refused to authorize the proposal, as did the ranking member, Senator Carl Levin. Through the hearings and investigations that followed, we unearthed a crushing body of evidence on how much a folly the proposal actually was. Throughout 2002 and in the beginning of 2003, even agencies within the Defense Department and the Air Force, including Program, Analysis and Evaluation, the Office of Management and Budget, and even the Air Force's own General Counsel's Office raised salient concerns about aspects of the proposal. These concerns, however, would not get in the way of Air Force leadership. Rather than resolve these concerns, Air Force proponents continued to aggressively push the deal in the press. A Wall Street Journal editorial entitled ``John McCain's Flying Circus,'' published on the very same day as the tanker hearing we had in the Commerce Committee, is particularly notable. It was obviously drafted with considerable help from the Office of the Air Force Secretary. In it, tanker proponents accused me of ``trying to prevent approval by running up my own Jolly Roger'' and brazenly exaggerated the Air Force's need for tankers by describing how, during Secretary Roche's visit to Tinker Air Force Base, he ``peeled back the skin of a tanker being refurbished and found the metal underneath disintegrating before his very eyes.'' By this time, Air Force leadership's aggressive press campaign was well underway. On April 25, 2002, Secretary Roche's special assistant, William Bodie, told Secretary Roche that he: saw Rudy deLeon [who heads Boeing's Washington office]-- And, by the way, he has rotated back and forth between the Congress and defense corporations and the Defense Department--he: saw Rudy deLeon at the Kennedy Center and politely asked the Great White Arab Tribe of the North [which is what these folks called Boeing] to unleash their falcons on our behalf for once. I talked to [defense analyst] Loren [Thompson], who is standing by to comment to this reporter about the national security imperatives of tanker modernization. [Editor of Defense News and Air Force Times] Vago [Murandian] is also standing by. I will get with [Assistant Air Force Secretary for Acquisitions Marvin] Sambur first thing to rehearse talking points. Get that, ``to rehearse talking points'' with the editor of Defense News and Air Force Times and defense analyst Loren Thompson: We will get with you before we talk to the reporter. Among the falcons that Boeing ``unleashed'' was an op-ed that subsequently appeared in Vago Muradian's Defense News. This piece, which strongly endorsed Boeing's tanker lease, was supposedly written by former Commander-in-Chief for U.S. Pacific Fleet Admiral Archie Clemins. However, Admiral Clemins has admitted, and Boeing's e-mails reflect, that it was in fact ghost-written and placed by Boeing. As this indicates, rather than address salient concerns regarding the tanker deal raised by their own staff, Air Force leadership focused on using the press, which Mr. Bodie described as ``3rd Party support at its best'' to perpetuate the fiction that ``the lease was the exact opposite of a Boeing `bailout.' '' Among the spin that lease advocates fed the press, were statements like, ``[I] will not succeed in blocking a 767 lease because tanker replacement is critical and [I] have offered no alternatives to leasing.'' While Air Force leadership was focused on pushing the deal in the press, analyses from several independent bodies, including the Defense Department's Office of the Inspector General, the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, the National Defense University, the Center for Naval Analysis, the Institute for Defense Analyses, and others criticized almost every aspect of the program. Perhaps most notably, a Defense Science Board Task Force, vetted for conflicts with industry only after my insistence, concluded that the need to replace the current tanker fleet was not urgent. The Task Force's finding debunked the numerous representations Air Force leadership made to the contrary. Indeed, the Defense Science Board suggested that the Air Force's case on corrosion was virtually cut from whole cloth. Air Force leadership repeatedly cited this case as the biggest reason for having taxpayers pay Boeing billions more than necessary. About 2 months ago, Ms. Druyun was sentenced to 9 months in prison on public corruption charges. Her crime: negotiating the $30 billion deal with Boeing while negotiating with Boeing for a job. Ms. Druyun's sentencing occurred months after Boeing's board of directors fired her and former Chief Financial Officer Michael Sears for misconduct arising from the tanker negotiations. Boeing's Chief Executive Officer Phil Condit soon left the company under a cloud of suspicion. In court papers accompanying her sentencing, Ms. Druyun admitted to overpricing Boeing's 767s as a ``parting gift'' to Boeing. She admitted that she did this to ``ingratiate herself'' with her future employer and help secure employment for her daughter and future son-in-law at the company. Astonishingly, Ms. Druyun also admitted that she similarly harmed the United States on behalf of Boeing on several other major defense programs, including the NATO AWACS, C-130 AMP, and the C-17 programs. How much taxpayers were fleeced remains unclear. These contracts were in the billions. But this matter remains under investigation by the Justice Department and other authorities. The scope of these investigations seems to widen almost weekly. Ultimately, it is likely that Ms. Druyun's misconduct cost taxpayers an astronomical sum. In yesterday's paper, Lockheed is bringing suit against Boeing for allegedly having involvement with bid rigging on other contracts as well. Over the past few weeks, Air Force leadership has tried to delude the American people into believing that all of this happened because of one person, and that because no one else has been hired for her position, the problem has been solved. I don't buy it. I simply cannot believe that one person, acting alone, can rip off taxpayers out of possibly billions of dollars. This appears to be a case of either a systemic failure in procurement oversight, willful blindness, or rank corruption. Either way, full accountability among Air Force leadership is in order. Just this week, Secretary Roche and Ms. Druyun's old boss, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisitions Marvin Sambur, announced their resignations. But, among Air Force leadership, nor one has assumed responsibility for this debacle. Ms. Druyun is, perhaps grudgingly, accepting responsibility for her role. To some extent, Boeing has accepted responsibility for its. The Justice Department and others are continuing to ferret out others who may be responsible. However, accountability among Air Force leadership has been almost nonexistent. It seems that it is business as usual. Air Force leadership remains content laying all the [[Page S11538]] blame at the feet of a single individual, Darleen Druyun. I'm not buying it. Just on the Tanker Lease Proposal, the conduct of Air Force leadership has been unacceptable. First, Air Force leadership was never interested in doing a formal ``analysis of alternatives'' for the multibillion dollar tanker program. Such AOAs are typically always done for major defense programs. Second, Air Force leadership misrepresented to Congress how bad corrosion afflicted the current tanker fleet. They did this to devise a reason why taxpayers needed to lease new tankers from Boeing, rather than simply buy them at a much lower cost. Third, according to independent analyses, Air Force leadership overstated ``operation and supply'' cost-growth estimates for the current tanker fleet. This too was done to artificially bolster the case that the current fleet needed to be replaced immediately, at a dramatically higher cost. Fourth, Air Force leadership repeatedly misrepresented that its proposal was merely an ``operating lease.'' Their plan was to slip the program in the budget at a relatively modest initial cost, only to have actual costs balloon in the intervening years. We now know that this was done to conceal the Tanker Lease Proposal's real budgetary impact. By the way, they also had plans that the money to fund in the later years, known as outyears in Pentagonese, that would be taken from the other services' budget. Fifth, according to the Defense Department's Inspector General, the commercial procurement strategy that Air Force leadership used in the tanker proposal (and, incidentally, the C-130J program) placed the Department at ``high risk for paying excessive prices,'' and precluded ``good fiduciary responsibility for DoD funds.'' Sixth, the Inspector General found that, when the specifications for the tanker were being developed, Air Force leadership let Boeing tailor those specifications to Boeing's proposed tanker. They were not tailored to the operational requirements of the warfighter. They should have been. Yet, Air Force leadership allowed an Air Force briefer to tell the Joint Staff that the tanker ``operational requirements document'' was not tailored to Boeing's aircraft. The Defense Department Inspector General, however, found that it was. I could go on, but I'll stop here for now. As I've gone into many of these points in excruciating detail in my letter to Secretary Rumsfeld on July 28, 2004, I'll simply ask for unanimous consent to have my letter printed into the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: July 28, 2004. Hon. Donald H. Rumsfeld, Secretary, Department of Defense The Pentagon, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Secretary: I am concerned about how the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the Tanker Lease Proposal will be conducted. In particular, I am concerned about the participation of Air Force leadership in the AoA, and the involvement of the Air Force's federally funded research and development center (FFRDC)--RAND, which I understand is spearheading this effort. The conduct of Air Force leadership regarding the Tanker Lease Proposal has been unacceptable. Frankly, its credibility on the recapitalization of the tanker fleet has been fundamentally called into question. Notably, many of the problems that the Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General (DoD-OIG) found in the Tanker Lease Proposal are similar to those it recently found in the multibillion dollar C-130J procurement program. Bases for my concern about the participation of Air Force leadership in the AoA include, but are not limited to, the following. First, the Air Force has provided Congress inaccurate information in an attempt to justify its original proposal to lease 100 Boeing KC-767As. For example, Air Force Secretary Jim Roche has repeatedly advised Congress that, in the existing KC-135 fleet, ``corrosion is significant, pervasive, and represents an unacceptable risk.'' Secretary Roche has also emphasized to Congress increased operating costs in the current fleet as a basis for entering into the tanker lease. Air Force leadership has indicated that these elements create an ``urgent'' need to recapitalize the fleet. However, as you of course know, the DSB task force concluded that the Air Force's claims of unmanageable corrosion problems and cost growth were overstated. As such, the task force also concluded that ``[t]here is no compelling material or financial reason to initiate a replacement program prior to the completion of the AoA and the MCS.'' Thus, the task force jettisoned the ``dominant reason'' Secretary Roche first cited in his July 10, 2003, report to Congress as the basis for having taxpayers pay billions of dollars more for leasing tankers than they would for buying them. The Air Force's representations on this issue remains a matter of continuing investigative concern. In another example, to comply with the original authorizing statute, the Air Force misrepresented to Congress that its proposal to lease 100 Boeing KC-767 tankers was merely an operating lease. This would have obviated the requirement that the White House obtain advance budget authority for the whole lease proposal. But, the DoD-OIG and Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E;), as well as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the General Accounting Office (GAO) found that the procurement of these tankers is, in fact, a lease purchase. In addition, facts surrounding the original lease proposal made it clear that the transaction was a lease- purchase: under the original proposal, the Air Force conceded that the DoD is ``committed to earmark[ing] an additional $2B in FY08 and FY09 for the purchase of aircraft covered by the multi-year program under the terms of the proposed contract'' to head off a funding spike over the Future-Years Defense Program. Second, the DoD-OIG and the NDU concluded that the Air Force's commercial item procurement strategy ``prevented any visibility into Boeing's costs and required the Air Force to use a fixed-price type contract . . . The strategy also exempted [Boeing] from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data. The strategy places the Department at high risk for paying excessive prices and precludes good fiduciary responsibility for DoD funds.'' The NDU similarly concluded that ``[i]n a sole source, monopoly commercial environment, the government is not served well with limited price data'' and suggested that the Air Force neglected its fiduciary/ stewardship responsibilities. Notably, the DoD-OIG arrived at similar conclusions regarding the Air Force's mismanagement of the C-130J procurement program. In particular, the DoD-OIG found that, because the C-130J was improperly acquired as a commercial item, the Air Force did not have contractor-certified information on contract prices, costs, or profits, and therefore was ``limited'' in its ability to protect the Government against possible overpricing. Third, the DoD-OIG and the NDU also concluded that the operational requirements document (ORD) for tankers was not tailored, as it should have been, to the requirements of the warfighter, but rather to closely correlate to the Boeing KC- 767A. The DoD-OIG found that senior Air Force staff directed that the ORD closely correlate to the Boeing KC-767A that was being developed for a foreign government, in anticipation of the authorizing legislation. This is particularly troubling where, according to an internal Boeing document regarding the ORD, Boeing planned to ``establish clearly defined requirements in ORD for the USAF Tanker configuration that results in an affordable solution that meets the USAF mission needs and will prevent an AOA from being conducted.'' Under the current proposal, the first 100 tankers produced will not be capable of, among other things, interoperability with Navy, Marine, or coalition assets, or simultaneously refueling more than one receiver aircraft. Rear Adm. Mark P. Fitzgerald, USN, recently suggested that in theater, such a limitation restricts the Navy's long range striking capability and fosters a needlessly risky aerial refueling environment. Notably, with respect to the C-130J procurement program, the DoD-OIG similarly found that, while the Air Force conditionally paid Lockheed Martin about $2.6 billion, the C- 130J is not operationally suitable or effective and cannot perform its intended mission. Furthermore, to date, 36 deficiency reports that ``could cause death, severe injury or illness, major loss of equipment or systems, or that could directly restrict combat or operational readiness'' have been received. Finally, Boeing documents suggest that the Air Force allowed Boeing to modify the requirements in the ORD while it was being developed. These documents also reflect that the Air Force induced the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) into approving and validating the corrupted ORD by falsely representing that it was not tailored to a specific aircraft. This is of continuing investigative interest to the Committee. Interestingly, as a result of the commercial specifications of the C-130J not meeting user needs, the Air Force (and Marine Corp) decided to ``revise its requirements document'' to reduce the initial capabilities required and to satisfy operational requirement deficiencies through block upgrade programs at the Government expense. I am very concerned about this. I understand that RAND (the Air Force's FFRDC), and Project Air Force in particular, is spearheading the AoA. Generally, the Air Force, specifically Dr. Sambur, is ``the overall sponsor'' for Project Air Force activities. However, having argued against the need for an AoA as early as November 2002, according to a recently produced internal DoD e-mail, Dr. Sambur has apparently prejudged its outcome: ``A formal AoA will cost money, delay the program two years, and still come up with the same answer we have today. There are only a few aircraft that can serve as tankers, they are already in production, and so analyzing their respective capabilities and costs won't take long--in fact, it's already been done and the results passed to OSD. What's left to study?'' [[Page S11539]] As I originally indicated in my letter of March 12, 2004, Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General T. Michael Moseley similarly touted the Air Force's proposal to lease and buy Boeing 767s during recent budget hearings. In particular, General Moseley provided ``opinion'' testimony suggesting that the KC-767 tanker is the Air Force's only viable option. For example, in testimony before the Projection Force Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, General Moseley specifically rejected re-engining remaining KC-135Es (as the DSB task force recommended); modifying used aircraft (for example, DC-10s, also as the DSB task force suggested); using contractor support services (as the GAO recently opined), and other options that your office's AoA guidance specifically required the Air Force to examine. While General Moseley attempted to explain away his testimony as ``personal opinion,'' at no time was he asked to provide his personal opinion and at no time during his testimony did General Moseley indicate that he was conveying a personal opinion. Considering General Moseley's role as the chairman of the Air Force Steering Group for Project Air Force and, respectfully, despite your assurances in your March 17, 2004, letter, I remain concerned that the Air Force and RAND have effectively prejudged the outcome of the AoA regarding the Tanker Lease Proposal. Several recently produced internal DoD e-mails call into question whether the ongoing AoA will be conducted objectively. For example, in an e-mail, dated August 15, 2003, from Secretary Roche to Dr. Sambur and Acting Undersecretary Wynne, Secretary Roche dissuaded the OSD and Air Force staff from initiating an AoA. In this e-mail, Secretary Roche said the following: ``Agggggg, stop the nonsense! Don't even begin to start an unnecessary AoA at this point. All this would do is give the enemies of the lease an excuse from DoD to delay the 'lease, and really honk off the Appropriators. Let's see what comes out of conference, damn it! If the lease is approved then we can talk about how to decide on the recapitalization of the other 400 airplanes, but there is no rush here.'' Soon thereafter, Acting Secretary Wynne responded, ``I agree with Jim, [sic] What started this flurry of activity? I'd hate for our story to change.'' The foregoing does not inspire confidence that the current AoA will be conducted properly. My concern that RAND, in particular, may have prejudged the outcome of the AoA is underscored by its conclusion regarding tanker recapitalization in a recent report. In a December 2003 report entitled ``Investigating Optimal Replacement of Aging Air Force Systems,'' RAND, in particular Project Air Force, found--without the benefit of an AoA--that ``it appears to be optimal to replace the KC-135 by the end of the decade.'' Apparently relying on Air Force data and analysis that was ultimately rejected by the DSB task force, this conclusion comes unacceptably close to prejudging the outcome of the AoA and is inconsistent with the conclusions of the Air Force's own Economic Service Life Study; the GAO; and, most recently, the DSB task force, all of which found that the current fleet is viable through 2040. In light of the relationship between the RAND and the Air Force, as described above, there can be no assurance that RAND will conduct the AoA here with the desired independence. My concerns appear to be reflected in a recently released internal DoD e-mail from Eric Coulter, Deputy Director for Theater Assessments and Planning at Program, Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E;) to Nancy Spruill, co-chairperson of the Leasing Review Panel Working Group, dated August 7, 2003: ``I do not support RAND as the sole source or lead to conduct the Congressionally-directed independent tanker AoA. First, its [sic] sad that it takes Congress to direct the Department to do something it should do on its own. We've been Wingto get the AF to conduct an AoA for several years, but could never get AT&L;'s support to direct one. The AF clearly wanted to postpone it for as long as possible to delay the issue of recapitalizing the fleet. Now the Department is playing catch up. That said, [the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA)] has more experience to conduct this type of effort. In fact, [Air Mobility Command] relies on IDA to do a lot of its mobility analyses both for airlift and tankers. I believe the Department will get a better, more objective product than we would from RAND. I hope we're not letting IDA's cost review of the tanker lease color our opinion. Please convince me otherwise.'' I am also concerned about the fact that Project Air Force may have received as much as $50 million for FY03 and FY04 and is expected to get at least another $25 million for FY05. This financial relationship between the Air Force and RAND renders RAND unsuitable for conducting the AoA on this multibillion dollar procurement proposal. Given the foregoing, I respectfully suggest that the Air Force not enter into an agreement to procure aerial refueling aircraft until an entity independent of the Air Force--on the basis of a study not funded directly or indirectly by the Air Force--completes the AoA. As always, I appreciate your consideration. Sincerely; John McCain, Chairman. Mr. McCAIN. What I would like to do now is discuss documents, belatedly produced by the Defense Department, that underscore the need for accountability among Air Force leadership regarding the tanker lease proposal. While the total number of documents that the Defense Department has produced remains unsatisfactory, the few that have been produced are compelling. On February 5, 2002, Air Force Secretary Roche personally assured me, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the tanker program, that he ``believed in competition,'' and ``would come back to Congress'' if another competitive proposal was particularly good. Secretary Roche's e-mails, however, suggests that he is indeed a man who allows his personal animus to stifle competition. For example, on September 5, 2002, Darleen Druyun wrote to Secretary Roche, ``I read with disgust the article on Airbus tankers from the new EADS CEO of North America. What BS . . . should not have been surprised at the slime . . . his day of reckoning will come hopefully.'' Secretary Roche answered, ``Oy. I agree. I had hoped you would have stayed and tortured him slowly over the next few years until EADS got rid of him!'' This is from the guy who says he believes in competition. His personal contempt for one defense contractor, and particularly its CEO, is clearly reflected in his other e-mails. For example, on August 7, 2002, when Secretary Roche learned that Ralph Crosby, with whom Secretary Roche once worked at Northrop Grumman, was appointed to the head EADS' North American operations, Secretary Roche wrote to his special assistant, William Bodie: Well, well, we'll have fun with Airbus. The day after, William Swanson at Raytheon asked Secretary Roche: Did you see the notice on Ralph in EADS? Secretary Roche responded: Right. Privately between us: Go Boeing! The fools in Paris and Berlin never did their homework. And, Ralphie is the CEO and chairman of a marketing firm, for that's all there is to EADS, North America. The [Air Force] has problems with EADS on a number of levels. The widespread feelings about Crosby and the Air Staff, Jumper especially, will only make their life more difficult. Smiles. On September 4, 2002, Mr. Bodie wrote Secretary Roche complaining about statements EADS issued about its tanker proposal: We don't have to turn the other cheek, you know. I'm ready to tell the truth about Airbus' boom, footprint, and financial shortcomings. But maybe we should sleep on it. In response, Secretary Roche wrote: No, sir, save it and blow him away. He admits they were not technically qualified! And, we keep their record of bribes as our trump card! This is the Secretary of the Air Force communicating with an assistant of his saying ``we keep their record of bribes as our trump card.'' Remarkable. Taken together, these documents inject serious doubt into Secretary Roche's commitment to competition in contracting, about which he assured me in congressional testimony. During hearings on the controversy in the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, I expressed concern about Secretary Roche asking Boeing to pressure dissenting elements within the Office of the Secretary of Defense into playing ball on tankers. However, in congressional testimony, Secretary Roche categorically denied this. For example, at a September 3, 2003, Commerce Committee hearing, I asked Secretary Roche about a Boeing e-mail dated 23 June 2003, ``Subject: Roche Meeting 23 June 2003.'' In particular, I asked Secretary Roche: Do you have any recollection whatsoever of telling . . . anyone . . . from Boeing to put pressure on [Acting Assistant Secretary for Acquisitions] Mike Wynne to convince [Program Analysis, and Evaluation] to write a new letter essentially undoing the first letter [which criticized the proposal]? After significant waffling, Secretary Roche responded: No, sir. I talked to [PA&E; Director] Ken Krieg, and in fact, I told him, ``Don't bother writing another letter.'' We understood these were his arguments. Again, on September 4, 2003, at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, I asked the same question to Secretary Roche: [[Page S11540]] Do you have any recollection whatsoever of telling . . . anyone . . . from Boeing to put pressure on Mike Wynne to convince PA&E; to write a new letter essentially undoing the first letter? I might say that the first letter from this part of the Pentagon was very critical of the tanker lease deal. This time Secretary Roche testified: I did not ask them to put pressure [on Wynne]. Finally, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 2, 2004, Secretary Roche adamantly denied asking the Boeing company to put pressure on Mike Wynne. Secretary Roche said: I've told you there was no pressure. . . .[I] certainly did not tell them to pressure anybody. Secretary Roche's e-mails, however, paint a very different picture. From Boeing's e-mails, here is what we know. In a June 23, 2003, e- mail to Jim Albaugh, who is head of Boeing's defense subsidiary, Boeing executive Thomas Owens described a meeting during which Secretary Roche expressed serious concerns about this letter from Mr. Ken Krieg. Mr. Krieg is the Director of Program Analysis, and Evaluation at the Office of the Secretary of Defense. His letter was key. In that letter, Director Krieg concluded that the original Boeing proposal failed two key Government accounting rules and, therefore, violated the authorizing legislation. According to Mr. Owens's e-mail, Secretary Roche ``ask[ed] [Boeing] to put pressure on [Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisitions] Mike Wynne to convince PA&E; to write a new letter essentially undoing the first letter.'' Soon after, Dr. Sambur wrote Secretary Roche regarding the PA&E; letter saying: Boss, this is getting ridiculous. Secretary Roche wrote to Acting Assistant Secretary Wynne as follows: Ever since Pete-- They are talking about former Assistant Secretary Aldridge-- left, the bureaucrats who opposed the 767 lease have come out of the woodwork to try to kill it--yet, once again, Mike, I won't sign a letter that makes the case that we shouldn't lease the planes. Ken Krieg's memo attached is a cheap shot, and I'm sure has already been delivered to the enemies of the lease on the Hill. It is a process foul. And Ken needs to be made aware of that by you! I can't control the corporate staff on acquisition issues. Mike, this is their way of asserting dominance over you. I know this sounds wild, but animals are animals. Pete had beaten them down. Now, they're taking you on. I'm sorry. Expecting professional behavior from them is something I gave up on a while back. Among other things, they are about to embarrass SecDef-- That is Secretary of Defense-- who having approved the lease, will now have to explain why his staff is destroying the case for it. I'll do whatever I can to help you, Mike, but [it's] your job to get the corporate staff under control. If not now, then they will overrun you whenever you ``don't behave'' according to their desires. This is a game they played for years. [They] and OMB are trying to set the Air Force up to be destroyed by Sen McCain with OSD-- Office of Secretary of Defense-- and OMB-- Office of Management and Budget-- arguments. As you might imagine, I won't give them the chance, but I will make it clear who is responsible to Don [Rumsfeld]. I refuse to wear my flack jacket backwards! This is after testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee that Secretary Roche never put any pressure on anybody. This is remarkable. Subsequently, Assistant Secretary Wynne reprimanded Director Krieg. In response to an e-mail from Director Krieg that attempted to clear the air, Secretary Roche rather disingenuously answered: Kenny, I love you, and you know that. I think you have been had by some members of the famous PA&E; staff. You never should have put what you put in writing. It will now be used against me and Don Rumsfeld. Other e-mails corroborate that Secretary Roche suggested to Boeing that it lobby the Office of the Secretary of Defense to undercut Program Analysis and Evaluation. For example, a December 17, 2002, e- mail from Boeing's top lobbyist Andy Ellis to Rudy deLeon, who heads Boeing's Washington office and served as a Deputy Defense Secretary in 2000 and 2001 described ``some quick notes from Jim [Albaugh]'s meeting today. It instructed, ``Please do not re-distribute this e-mail.'' The e-mail memorialized what was said during ``[a] meeting with Sec. Roche'' as follows: PA&E; now a problem on tankers--arguments include price, 767 footprint and prospects for ``used 767s.'' Boeing needs to do more on behalf of tankers in the Office of Secretary of Defense. PA&E; working to convince Aldridge to delay--reengine while doing an analysis of alternatives. We should vector hill support for tankers at Aldridge. . . . said he is very comfortable with the price air force has on tanker, and very comfortable with overall deal. It is the right time to do this deal. He is waiting until early January to push on the Office of Management and Budget--wants to deal with the next congress, not the current. . . . Boeing needed to work White House and especially Office of Secretary of Defense. That is from the Secretary of the Air Force. Other e-mails recently produced by the Department of Defense corroborate the shocking dynamic whereby Secretary Roche apparently orchestrated efforts against tanker lease critics within the Office of the Secretary of Defense. For example, in a May 7, 2003, e-mail, Paul Weaver, a Boeing lobbyist and former Director of the Air National Guard, wrote Secretary Roche as follows: Rudy [DeLeon] called me and said that Marv Sambur was getting beat up by Mike Wynne again concerning the $125 million number per aircraft. Rudy would like to know if he needs to do anything like calling in the big guns to help out. I told him I would query you to get your advice. In response, Secretary Roche wrote: It's time for the big guns to quash Wynne! Boeing won't accept such a dumb contract form and price, and Wynne needs to ``pay'' the appropriate price! Now, that is the Secretary of the Air Force talking about another member of the Pentagon in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Program Analysis and Evaluation: Wynne needs to ``pay'' the appropriate price. I wonder what he was talking about. These e-mails call into serious question whether Secretary Roche was truthful in testifying that he had not directed Boeing to pressure tanker lease critics within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to play ball. During last year's hearings, we released e-mails indicating that Secretary Rumsfeld's policy analysts may have been improperly lobbying the Office of the Secretary of Defense in support of the tanker lease proposal. Another set of e-mails, only recently produced, give a fuller picture of this issue. For example, in an October 9, 2002, e-mail, Darleen Druyun wrote Secretary Roche and Dr. Sambur saying: I would like to informally brief [Defense Science Board Chairman] Bill Schneider on tanker leasing when he gets back from Germany. I had briefed him during the transition about the idea of leasing as a viable acquisition alternative. He has apparently had a positive conversation with Wolfowitz on leasing and is interested in quietly helping us. This is the head of the Defense Science Board, who is supposed to be making decisions about weapons systems and other acquisitions, and he is ``interested in quietly helping us.'' If you give the nod we will use the same charts we used to brief Gingrich which was very positively received by him. Secretary Roche responded: Please do. Thanks much. This e-mail, and others I have released, raise serious questions about the undue influence that industry exerts on procurement decisions in the Pentagon. What is striking here is that in this case, Air Force leadership seems to have been deep in the middle of it. To what I have described already, add the doctoring of documents produced to Congress. After SASC, Senate Armed Services Committee, staff returned from their visit from Tinker Air Force Base in October 2003, they asked for some placards that reflected unusually low failure rates associated with component parts of the KC-135s maintained there. That is the present Air Force fleet of tankers. Shockingly, what the Senate Armed Services Committee staff received were altered versions of what they asked for. I conveyed my concerns about these doctored documents directly to Secretary Roche. In Secretary Roche's February 27, 2004, response to me, he conceded that the information that the Senate Armed Services Committee requested was intentionally deleted. In particular, he explained: [[Page S11541]] As those placards featured ``Tinker-only'' information, and because our installations and logistics professionals strive to present a complete and timely picture of our fleet, they amended the placard file by omitting the ``Tinker-only'' occurrence factors. To add insult to injury, the explanation that the Air Force leadership provided to the press about what happened was different entirely. Furthermore, we have yet to learn who in Secretary Roche's office directed that the information that Congress asked for be doctored before it was delivered. It seems that whatever documents Air Force leadership did not doctor, they improperly withheld. For example, on Friday, September 10, 2004, the White House Counsel's Office and the Office of Management and Budget brought to my staff's attention a very troubling e-mail stream between Secretary Roche and senior OMB official, Robin Cleveland. After Darleen Druyun went to work for Boeing, Ms. Cleveland, the Associate Director for National Security Programs, represented the Government in negotiating with Boeing on the tanker lease proposal. In this e-mail stream beginning on May 9, 2003, Ms. Cleveland asked Secretary Roche to help her brother get a job at Northrop Grumman. The e-mail said: Jim, this is my brother's [Peter Cleveland's] stuff. I would appreciate anything you can do to help with NG-- that means Northrop Grumman-- He is an incredibly hard working, disciplined guy--worked full-time, with two little kids, putting himself through law school at night. I would be grateful. Thanks very much. Robin About half an hour later, Secretary Roche gave Mr. Cleveland's resume and cover letter, and, under color of his office and title, vouched for him to Steve Dyslas, a Northrop Grumman executive: I know this guy. He is good. His sister (Robin) is in charge of defense and intel at OMB. We used to work together in senior staff. If Peter Cleveland looks good to you, pls [sic] add my endorsement. A few minutes later, Secretary Roche wrote Ms. Cleveland in an e- mail: Be well. Smile. Give me tankers now. (Oops. Did I say that? My new deal is terrific.) Now, the person who is responsible for overseeing the national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget, the watchdog of all the budgetary issues in America, that one specifically charged with overseeing tankers, asked the Secretary of the Air Force to get her brother a job. He, under his title and name, contacts the defense corporation that does business with the U.S. Air Force and asks them to give Ms. Cleveland's brother a job, and then after sending it, sends an e-mail back to Ms. Cleveland: Be well. Smile. Give me tankers now. (Oops. Did I say that? My new deal is terrific.) On May 15, 2003, Ms. Cleveland responded to her brother in an e-mail entitled: ``Interview at NG,'' saying, ``Great. Hope it works before the tanker leasing issue gets fouled up.'' Until these e-mails were brought to our attention by the White House, we never even knew about them. In a meeting with me on September 13, 2004, White House Counsel Judge Alberto Gonzales told me that someone in Secretary Roche's office concluded that these e-mails were a joke and therefore they did not need to be produced. That has to be taken in the context that they told me that they would give me these e-mails as part of our oversight responsibility. The Secretary of the Air Force decided the e-mails that I just cited were not relevant to the tanker deal. So if there is some level of mistrust that exists between me and my office and the Secretary, maybe that clears up that degree of mistrust a little bit. Given all the scandal and controversy surrounding the tanker lease proposal, and especially given the keen interest that Chairman Warner and I have expressed regarding potential Air Force misconduct, the unilateral decision made by Air Force leadership to withhold this document is profoundly disturbing. Keeping a defense contractor's ``record of bribes'' as a ``trump card''; ``torturing'' a defense contractor ``slowly''; pressuring dissenting elements within the Office of the Secretary of Defense whose job it was, particularly in the absence of a Defense Acquisition Board--in other words a formal analysis--to vet this procurement program; signing off on a plan to get the chairman of the Defense Science Board to ``quietly help'' on the tanker lease inside the OSD; doctoring and improperly withholding documents requested by Congress: this is the picture that we are getting on what happened with the tanker proposal, and we have received only a few documents from 6 out of 30 people we have asked for. This is the picture we are getting, but no one among Air Force leadership stands up to assume responsibility. Instead, what we get from Air Force leadership is deeply troubling statements in the press about how rosy things are. For example, in a recent op-ed appearing in Defense News, Dr. Sambur describes the current acquisition process as ``healthy'' and ``on track.'' Hoping that Air Force leadership will ``get it'' now may perhaps be too much, when they didn't ``get it'' then. In that context, I find particularly troubling an e-mail from Air Force Under Secretary Teets to Secretary Roche sent just 3 days after Boeing announced the firing of CFO Michael Sears and Vice President Darlene Druyun. In it, Under Secretary Teets writes: Jim, I think it is important for you to know all I know about the situation surrounding the tankers . . . Late Tuesday afternoon I talked to Marv Sambur and got his assurance that a thorough review of the Darlene situation had been completed and there was no way Darlene had any influence on our plan for tankers. Furthermore, Marv said that a letter had been prepared for the DepSecDef to send over to the SASC indicating same, and notifying them of our intent to proceed. So two people are fired by Boeing because of information that has come to light about improper behavior and later the individual pleads guilty in court--in fact, both of them have now pled guilty in court. Ms. Druyun has confessed that she rigged the contracts as a ``parting gift to Boeing'' in behalf of her daughter and son-in-law's employment. Meanwhile, the Under Secretary of the Air Force writes to the Secretary of the Air Force that he talked to Marv Sambur, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, and got his assurance that ``a thorough review of the Darlene situation had been completed and there was no way Darlene had any influence on our plan for the tankers.'' I am amazed. I am amazed. One thing is for sure: the final chapter on the tanker lease proposal cannot be closed until all the stewards of taxpayers funds who committed wrongdoing, are held accountable. In order to get a full accounting of what happened on the tanker lease proposal, I will continue to insist that all the documents that the Senate Armed Services Committee has asked for, be produced--no matter how long it takes In closing, Air Force Doctrine Document 1-1 on Leadership and Force Development contains a section setting forth the Air Force's core values. There are three: integrity, service before self, and excellence in all they do. The first, integrity, includes the indispensable characteristics of accountability, responsibility, honesty, and honor. When it comes to Air Force leadership's conduct regarding the tanker lease proposal and related congressional probes, I must however ask: where is the accountability and the responsibility; where is the honesty and the honor; where have these core values been over the past 3 years, and where are they now? To eschew accountability here is to do a profound disservice to the good men and women who wear the uniform of the United States Air Force honorably, capably, and proudly. For those in the public interested in what I have discussed today, I will be posting all of these documents on my website, www.mccain.senate.gov. In closing, the scandal continues to widen. Yesterday one of the competitors of Boeing alleged that information was leaked by Ms. Druyun, and the CEO of Boeing. I don't know if it is true. I doubt if it is true. I have no way of knowing. But the scandal continues to unfold. As I said, we have only received a small percentage of the documents and e-mails that we have asked for. This is a very sad chapter. I was asked last week by a reporter for the Air Force Times if this was personal with me, this issue I have discussed on the Senate floor for the past half hour or so. [[Page S11542]] It is personal in this respect. It is personal that I had the privilege of serving in the U.S. military and wearing the uniform. I believe we always expect not only the same standard but a higher standard of conduct of the men and women who wear the uniform, and the vast majority, 99 and 44/100 percent of the men and women who wear the uniform conduct themselves with the highest degree of honor, courage, and integrity. But here we have individuals who have, obviously, behaved in a less than honorable fashion. That is why it is necessary we get to the bottom of this. Next year, beginning January, we are going to have to look at the whole procurement process as it works today in the Department of Defense, because we have just found out that Ms. Druyun, in her guilty plea, said she was involved in rewarding Boeing on several other contracts, not just the Boeing tanker lease. We have no idea how much money that is. But it brings a profound question here: How could one person do this? How could one person alone in the whole Pentagon--I have forgotten how many thousands of people work there--have done this and they not know about it? If they didn't know about it, what kind of a system is it that allows such a thing to take place, over a period of years? I deeply regret having been involved in this. But I also remind my colleagues that the way this thing started was the insertion in an appropriations bill that was one line that no member of the Senate Armed Services Committee had any knowledge of nor did the Senate Armed Services Committee have a single hearing on before this appeared as a line item in an appropriations bill. That is not the way to do business. I would allege to you right now, if it had gone through the normal authorization process perhaps this whole scandal wouldn't have unfolded the way it did because we would have had a hearing. We would have scrutinized the proposal. We would have gone through the normal process. Instead, we spent 3 years fighting a rearguard action and through the sheerest kind of luck, in many respects, we are able to identify this wrongdoing. I hope we can get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible and find lessons learned, find out how much money we can reclaim, if necessary, on behalf of the taxpayers, so that if, indeed, Ms. Druyun's statement is true--and I have no reason not to believe what she confessed to, that she issued a number of contracts that were detrimental to the cause of the American taxpayer--we can reform the system so this kind of thing can never happen again.

Mr. President, yesterday I spoke on the Senate floor regarding the investigation into the Air Force proposal to acquire Boeing 767 aerial refueling tankers. During my 45 minute remarks, I had made reference to certain letters, press articles and e-mails I ask unanimous consent that that material at a cost of $3,200.00 be printed in the Record of today's proceedings. U.S. Senate, Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC, Dec. 2, 2003. Hon. Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Washington, DC. Dear Secretary Wolfowitz: I commend the Secretary of Defense and yourself for the prompt actions you have taken regarding the Air Force's tanker aircraft program, in light of recent extraordinary personnel actions taken by the Boeing Company. Your decision to require a ``pause'' in the execution of any contracts to lease and purchase tanker aircraft is a prudent management step. Further, I concur in your judgment to task the Department of Defense Inspector General, DOD-IG, to conduct an independent assessment. However, I believe that the DOD-IG assessment should go further than the review described ion your letter of December 1, 2003. The DOD-IG inquiry should pursue the trail of evidence wherever it leads, in accordance with standard IG procedures. This inquiry should examine the actions of all members of the Department of Defense and the Department of the Air Force, both military and civilian, top to bottom, who participated in structuring and negotiating the proposed tanker lease contract which was submitted to the Congress in July 2003. Your recent actions clearly indicate that there are many outstanding questions that must be answered before proceeding with this program. I expect that you will consult further with the Congress as you receive the report of the DOD-IG and that no actions will be taken with respect to the lease and purchase of KC-767 tanker aircraft until the Congress has had an opportunity to review the DOD-IG report. Ultimately, this program, as restructured, must be executed in a manner that is fully consistent with Section 135 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-136). With kind regards, I am Sincerely, John Warner, Chairman. ____ U.S. Senate, Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC, Nov. 19, 2004. Hon. Donald H. Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Secretary: On December 2, 2003, Chairman Warner wrote to Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz to request that the Department of Defense Inspector General (DOD IG) conduct a thorough investigation of the KC-767A tanker aircraft program. According to Chairman Warner's letter ``this inquiry should examine the actions of all members of the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of the Air Force, both military and civilian, top to bottom, who participated in structuring and negotiating the proposed tanker lease contract which was submitted to the Congress in July 2003.'' A copy of that letter is attached. It was our understanding that the requested DOD IG review would assess not only individual responsibility for any allegations of criminal violations of law; but, equally important, individual accountability for management decisions and executive oversight. In essence, the Senate Committee on Armed Services, in order to conduct its necessary legislative oversight of the Department of Defense, needs to know what happened, who was accountable and what actions must be taken to prevent this situation from happening again. It is astonishing to us that one individual could have so freely perpetrated, for such an extended period, this unprecedented series of fraudulent decisions and other actions that were not in the best interest of the Department of Defense. We recently found out that no such managerial accountability review has been undertaken by the DOD IG. Rather, the DOD IG limited his review to determining whether there was evidence to press criminal charges. We are deeply concerned by this development. Given the Chairman's letter, why was a decision made not to do this work? Congressional oversight of the proposed contract to lease 100 KC-767A tanker aircraft, a contract which is now prohibited by section 133 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, uncovered the most significant defense procurement scandal since the Ill Wind bribery and fraud [[Page S11777]] cases of the 1980s. It is imperative that the Department take actions to hold those responsible accountable. Otherwise, the fallout from this Air Force procurement scandal will have disastrous effects on the integrity of the acquisition system. In our view, an assessment of accountability should include a review of all members of the Department of Defense and the Department of the Air Force, both military and civilian, who participated in structuring and negotiating the proposed tanker lease contract. Most importantly, this should include Secretary of the Air Force Jim Roche, and Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Marvin Sambur. We reiterate the Committee's request that the DOD IG immediately initiate such an accountability review. Again, we do not understand how one individual could have amassed so much power that she was able to perpetuate such fraud against the federal government and other actions that were not in the best interest of the Department of Defense. Where was the oversight? Where were the checks and balances? At a minimum, the acquisition chain of the Air Force, and perhaps DOD, was woefully inadequate. The fact that no Departmental review of these questions has been conducted raises significant accountability and oversight questions that go far beyond this one case. We trust you will endeavor to rectify the situation and hold those who are responsible accountable. Sincerely, Carl Levin, Ranking Member. John McCain, U.S. Senator. John Warner, Chairman. ____ Deputy Secretary of Defense, Washington, DC, Nov. 19, 2004. Hon. John W. Warner, Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, the Department soon will complete the analysis of alternatives (AoA) for recapitalization of the KC-135 tanker aircraft fleet, and that portion of a broader mobility capability study (MCS) related to aerial refueling. Based upon the recommendations of the Defense Science Board, I accelerated, to November of this year, the schedule for completion of these initiatives. The AoA and MCS will be critical to our development of a plan to recapitalize the tanker fleet, and to provide adequate aerial-refueling capabilities for military aircraft over the long term. In structuring the AoA and MCS, we recognized that we should base the recapitalization of the fleet on a thorough and careful assessment of the ways in which we might perform the aerial-refueling mission. To ensure that we consider all viable solutions, the AoA addresses a wide range of alternatives, from the retention and re-engineering of KC- 135E aircraft to the development of a new military tanker aircraft. Let me be clear: After we have selected an appropriate alternative, we intend to require competition. No matter which alternative we choose, leasing is not an option without new congressional authority. Sincerely, Paul Wolfowitz. ____ [From the Defense News, Nov. 3, 2003] Full Disclosure In March, Defense News published a commentary by Adm. Archie Clemins, former commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. In it, he advocated a U.S. Air Force plan to lease 100 planes from Boeing Co., which would modify the 767s for the Air Force's aerial refueling mission. That a Navy man would back an Air Force program is what made it intriguing. What we didn't know at the time was that Clemins did not write the piece. Nor did he think on his own to write it. Nor, for that matter, did he even think to send it to Navy Times, a sister publication, without prompting. In truth, a Boeing representative came up with the idea, asked Clemins to write it, and provided a writer to help get the job done. Boeing also suggested where he ought to send it and provided him the e-mail address. Clemins says he was not paid for the article and stands by what it says. We believe that. But he acknowledged that prior to writing the article, he had done some paid consulting work for Boeing, and that he has since developed a more formal consulting arrangement with the company. He said he made no effort to ``pull the wool over anyone's eyes.'' In publishing the piece, regardless of who actually wrote it, we provided a forum for the free flow of ideas. That is the purpose of our Commentary pages. But we failed to do some things we should have done. We should have asked Clemins if he had a financial relationship with the program or the contractor. We should have asked if he had, in fact, written the article himself. And we should have weighed his answers in our thinking, because that information is essential to the context of his article. Had we known those things, we might still have published his opinion. But we would have included the other writer's name and noted Clemins' relationship with Boeing among his credentials at the end of the article. As it was, we merely noted that he was the former commander of the Pacific Fleet-- true, but not the whole story. Full disclosure is what we're after. Here, we fell short. We will work hard to ensure this doesn't happen again. ____ [From the Seattle Times, Nov. 18, 2004] Lockheed Allegations Focus on Boeing's Chief Exec Lockheed Martin has introduced evidence in a civil lawsuit that allegedly demonstrates Boeing Chief Executive Harry Stonecipher knew former Air Force acquisitions officer Darleen Druyun gave Boeing preferential treatment in the award of billions of dollars of Defense Department contracts before she joined the company last year. Additionally, Lockheed introduced evidence it says shows Stonecipher and James Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing's Integrated Defense Systems unit, attended a September 1998 meeting with Druyun and Air Force Col. Richard McKinney in which Boeing allegedly received details of a confidential Lockheed proposal to provide rocket launches to the Air Force. Druyun received a nine-month prison sentence last month for holding job talks with Boeing while still overseeing Boeing business at the Air Force. She further admitted to awarding more than $5 billion of Defense Department contracts to Boeing in exchange for jobs for her daughter, her son-in-law and herself. Boeing and Stonecipher have been adamant that if Druyun showed the company any favoritism, Boeing was not aware of it. ``The statements Ms. Druyun made in her sentencing papers came as a total surprise,'' Boeing said last month. However, Lockheed said in a court filing last week that it has ``an e-mail written by Mr. Stonecipher admitting that Darleen Druyun had favored Boeing in the past.'' It is not clear from the filing when the e-mail was written. The e-mail itself was placed under seal by the court. Lockheed and Boeing officials could not be reached for comment. Lockheed is pursuing a civil racketeering lawsuit against Boeing in Orlando, Fla., that accuses Boeing of using 40,000 pages of stolen Lockheed documents to gain an unfair advantage in a multibillion-dollar competition to provide satellite launches to the Air Force. Druyun was not tied to that case originally. But after her guilty plea last month, Lockheed sought Boeing e-mails and other documents showing contacts between Boeing and Druyun concerning both the rocket competition and several other contracts she awarded to Boeing rather than Lockheed. In October 1998, the Air Force awarded 19 launches to Boeing and seven to Lockheed. The Air Force cited Boeing's lower price-per-launch as a major reason for giving Boeing so many launches. Lockheed said in last week's court filing that handwritten notes of the September, 1998 meeting between Stonecipher, Albaugh, Druyun, McKinney and other Air Force officials suggest Boeing also received unfair treatment in the award of those launches by receiving confidential Lockheed pricing data. ``The fact that high-level Boeing officials discussed their proposal strategy and Lockheed Martin's pricing with Ms. Druyun shortly before the final (rocket) proposal submission is damning,'' Lockheed said. The meeting notes, taken by David Schweikle, project manager for Boeing's Delta IV rocket program, were, like the Stonecipher e-mail, placed under seal. U.S. Magistrate Judge Karla Spaulding last week agreed to let Lockheed lawyers question a Boeing representative about communications with Druyun on six contract competitions, including the rocket-launch contract. ``It may lead to admissible evidence about whether Boeing had improperly acquired proprietary information of Lockheed and others that it discussed with Druyun,'' the judge wrote. Boeing lawyers objected to the judge's order, and a hearing was set for next month to resolve the objections. The Boeing attorneys, in court filings, said Lockheed's request for information on Druyun is too broad, has nothing to do with the case and is an attempt by Lockheed Martin to concoct new complaints against Boeing. Chief weapons buyer for Air Force quits WASHINGTON--The Air Force's chief weapons buyer said yesterday he is resigning to help clear the way for promotions bottled up in Congress over a stalled $23.5 billion plan to acquire Boeing 767 tanker aircraft. Marvin Sambur said he had resigned as assistant Air Force secretary for acquisition effective Jan. 20, or sooner should President Bush's next choice for the job be confirmed before then. ``It's becoming pretty apparent that if I stayed it would be very difficult for the Air Force to have anybody confirmed,'' Sambur said in a telephone interview. On Tuesday, Air Force Secretary James Roche resigned in a move aides said was also designed to free up nominations of officers whose Senate confirmations were held up by Armed Services Committee member John McCain, R-Ariz. McCain had blocked a range of promotions over the Air Force proposal to acquire 100 Boeing 767 aerial tankers, which he slammed as a government handout to Boeing. Sambur was once the boss of Darleen Druyun, who admitted improperly steering billions of dollars of Air Force contracts to Boeing before joining the company as a [[Page S11778]] $250,000-a-year vice president in January 2003. A former president and chief executive of ITT Defense, Sambur oversees the Air Force's $37 billion procurement budget. ____ [The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 3, 2003] John McCain's Flying Circus No one denies that the U.S. Air Force needs more refueling tankers. The only questions are how and when to get them. Senator John McCain calls the Pentagon's answer, a leasing arrangement with Boeing, an unsavory example of the modern ``military-industrial complex,'' a mistaken argument he will no doubt pursue today at hearings before his Commerce Committee. It's hard to overestimate the importance of these flying gas stations. Long-range bombers make it to their targets only because they can refuel in the air. It was our tankers that enabled coalition aircraft to circle high above Iraq's battlefields for hours, providing ground troops with the capability to call in immediate, precision air strikes on emerging targets. ``Our tanker force is what makes us a global power'' is the way the Air Force chief of staff, General John Jumper, puts it. Yet for all that power, America's tanker fleet is in sad shape because the tankers are simply too old to keep flying. The Pentagon is hoping to remedy this quickly by leasing the tankers from Boeing, and three of the four relevant committees in Congress have given their approval to the contract. The fourth--the Senate Armed Services Committee-- will hold hearings tomorrow. Senator McCain's Commerce hearings today are his way of trying to preempt approval by running up his own Jolly Roger. Let's hope he doesn't draw the fight out too long. The average tanker is now more than 43 years old. During a visit last year to Oklahoma's Tinker Air Base, then-Air Force Secretary James Roche realized the urgency of the problem when he peeled back the skin of a tanker being refurbished and found the metal underneath disintegrating. Age isn't the only problem. Not only will the new Boeing 767s be able to refuel all planes in the military's inventory--unlike the existing KC 135E's--they carry up to 20% more fuel and three times the cargo. And the leasing arrangement used to get them to the Air Force is similar to the way foreign militaries buy planes, selecting off-the- shelf technology and then signing a contract for rapid delivery. This is how Israel and Singapore get the latest F- 16s five years before the U.S. Air Force. We're as opposed to sweetheart deals as anyone. But it seems to have escaped Senator McCain's notice that Boeing's main competitor here, the European consortium that produces Airbus, virtually defines corporate welfare. And so far as we can tell, the e-mails between Boeing, the Pentagon and the Air Force released by his committee last week seem to show only that Boeing was lobbying hard for a multibillion-dollar deal (surprise!) and that cost was a big concern. In short, the real issue the Senate Armed Services Committee needs to zero in on here isn't just overall lifetime cost but value for money. The Air Force needs tankers now, and the leasing arrangement was deemed the way to get tankers into its hands most expeditiously, not least because it bypasses procurement procedures that could stretch out a buying decision for years. Senator McCain and other critics like to talk about what he says are the billions more that a leasing deal will cost over buying these birds outright. Leaving aside the huge dispute over the price tag, let's hope the Armed Services Committee considers the costs our military might incur by not getting these tankers as soon as possible. ____ USAF e-mails on Boeing 767 Tanker Lease Proposal Originator, Date, Subject Roche, August 07, 2002, FW: Crosby Finds a Home at EADS; Bodie, Sept 04, 2002, Re: Fw: Defense Week Daily Update: EADS: Our Tanker Offer Cost Less Than Boeing's; Druyun, Sept 05, 2002, Our friend; Hodges, June 20, 2003, FW: KC-767 ``Savings'' for comment & Courtesy Copy of Memo; Wynne, June 23, 2003, Tankers; Weaver, May 7, 2003, 767 Lease; Druyun, Oct 9, 2002, Tanker Leasing; Calbis, Nov 7, 2001, CBO has questions about your scoring of the tankers; Roche, Friday, November 28, 2003, RE: Tankers; Roche, August 8, 2002, Re: hello?

I'll do whatever I can to help you, Mike, but it's your job to get the corporate staff under control. If not now, then they will overrun you whenever you ``don't behave'' according to their desires.

[[Page S11780]] From: Peter Teets SAF/US To: James Roche SAF/OS Date: 11/27/2003 Subj: Tankers Jim: I think it is important for you to know all I know about the situation surrounding the tankers. I sat in for you at the SecDef staff meeting last Tuesday. As we went around the table, Joe Schmitz (IG) mentioned the Boeing dismissal of Sears and Druyun. The SecDef then asked if in light of that should we take a second look at her involvement in any tanker lease related matters in order to deflect possible criticism from the SASC and unfavorable publicity. I said I thought that was a good idea, and that we (the Air Force) would do so. No further discussion on the subject occurred at the staff meeting. After the staff meeting I scheduled short separate meetings with Marv Sambur and Mary Walker for Tuesday afternoon following my return from a meeting at CIA. When I returned, I learned that Marv could not meet with me at the scheduled time because he was in Mike Wynne's office discussing Darlene's involvement with tankers. I then met with Mary and asked her to think through the Darlene situation, plus another matter regarding proper packaging of material on the AFA situation that Schmitz had said was required to be delivered to the SASC. Late Tuesday afternoon I then talked to Marv Sambur and got his assurance that a thorough review of the Darlene situation had been completed and that there was no way Darlene had any influence on our current plan for tankers. Furthermore, Marv said that a letter had been prepared for the DepSecDef to send over to the SASC indicating same, and notifying them of our intent to proceed. At that point, I thought the issue was resolved. On Wednesday morning I read the Wash Post article quoting Sec Rumsfeld as saying he had asked his staff to do a review of the tanker deal. I sent Marv and e-mail offering any help I could provide, and he responded with thanks, but it was clear that this situation had once again gotten out of control. I am sorry to report the news to you, but felt you needed the whole story as it unfolded. Best Regards, Pete.

Ralph is the President EAD's US. I am going to ask him how much a proposal would cost. They came in a couple of weeks ago and offered to build the majority here in America. You are welcome to attend, though, it may be best to let me in my present position do the probing. I will share with you, as I have in the other case, any findings. I'd suggest that this be held quietly, but I did want you to be aware. I am not sure where this will lead, but the benefits of competition may be revealing. Best, Mike. From: Wynne, Michael Mr. OSD-ATL To: Sambur, Marvin Dr. SAF/AQ Date: Wednesday, April 16, 2003 Subject: Tankers Marv; Some advance work for FY05 budgeting is in order. I suggest that you begin to probe whether there's sufficient funding to start a multi-year late in FY04 and in earnest in FY05. Not that we are done yet, IDA may surface changes that make it acceptable, but some of the arguments that were tabled make the case for tanker re-cap compelling. If I had some spare change hanging around, I'd give another supplier enough money to make a proposal for this as well. I'm not saying to buy anything other than a proposal. But, I think the leverage from that `spare change' would be enormous. For Boeing, the risk of losing the US tanker Franchise, no matter what our final intent is would be too embarrassing. I know the opposition would be vocal as well, but with the low probability of success, I think paying to prepare is fair. If chosen we could deduct it from the final deal. While these are idle thoughts for now, the discontent within the administration for what they perceive Boeing's response for assistance was is not good, and would support this contrary approach.

As I explained to you in a previous email, the offset or affordability issue is not as big a deal as Dov makes it out to be. The Chief has seen the details and the full details will be briefed to you on Wednesday at 4pm. The issue is that Aldridge wants a briefings by Dr. Spruill (co chair of the leasing committee) at 8:30 am tomorrow and Zakheim wants a briefing at 3:30 pm. Since we have a good story to tell, I think it would only cause unnecessary irritation if we refuse to give them the details until you are fully briefed. Is it OK to allow BG Johns with Spruill to give the briefing to Aldridge and Zakheim before you see the full details. The Chief had no issues and as I explained to you the OSD hot points are in the 09 time frame and involve an unknown bomber and funding for LAIRCM. Thanks! Marv. From: James Roche To: Pete Aldridge CC: Gen. John Jumper; Marvin Sambur; Bill Bodie Date: Nov 19, 2002 Subject: 767 Lease Pete, old Buddy, you have been our strongest supporter on the issue of the lease. I now hear that your staff is telling us that you are weakening. Please don't. Here is some food for thought: (1) Regardless of OMB, the deal is a good one for the taxpayer. (2) Every time we come forward with something good for the taxpayer, the bureaucrats (including yours) feel that they have to fight it (job security?) (3) To delay for two years to do an AOA is simply silly. It just means two more years of wasted repair costs on the E models; a waste of taxpayers' money to some beltway bandit; more bureaucratic delays by PA&E; and an end which is predictable. (4) Since neither ships, trucks, or tiny planes can serve as tankers, we will be looking at big planes. Guess what? We're already there. We will waste money and have nothing to show for it. (5) Hey, we can extend the life of the E's and re-engine them! We'll that doesn't pass Grant's lieutenant's test: it means we will be flying 80 year old planes in a few years!!!! Average age is now between 42 and 44 years. Re-engining won't solve the inherent catalytic corrosion problem. More waste of money. (6) Gee, why didn't we for 50 or 60 or 70 year old Air Force Ones? How many of our bureaucrats fly in such old planes? I'm getting used to some in their late 40s, but I'm not so picky! But, why don't we make the Navy sail 60 year old destroyers? Or submarines? Because it's dumb. (7) If we wait, there may not be a 767 line! Hey, can we covert used ones. Here we go again. We can waste money with half measurers that are penny wise and pound foolish. Why not do the same for ships? OK, so we'll be forced to buy French airplanes. (8) To kill this idea in OSD is proof that there may be words like ``acquisition reform,'' but they are hollow. The bureaucrats want to keep doing things the same old way, adding little value but lots of costs. I can only keep my sanity by remembering Andy's advice to me years ago: ``there are limits to the stupidity any one man can prevent.'' Off to Okinawa! Jim. Dr. James G. Roche, Secretary of the Air Force. From: Bill Bodie To: Jim Roche Date: Nov 20, 2002 Subject: Re: 767 Lease Good for you, boss. Aldridge may deny he's been weakening, but the smoke signals are thick. Aldridge interviewed with Anne Marie yesterday, and although he wouldn't comment on specifics of any deal and was keeping an open mind, he indicated that in general terms he would have concerns about leasing when/if buying was cheaper. That doesn't jibe with his previous support for the lease from a NPV/cash flow management perspective. In addition, the spores seem to be pushing a ``what's the rush?'' line: buying is cheaper (we ``exaggerate'' the purchase cost of a green 767), therefore better; such a large expenditure requires more ``rigorous analysis'' than the back-of-the-envelope assertions by the AF, hence an AOA; the AF hasn't POM'ed for the lease, so how serious can we be? There is no ``urgent'' need, because the AF is starting to retire the E's next year even without an immediate replacement, so why can't we be more deliberative? Boeing will still be there, making airplanes, so what's the rush? Anyway, Airbus could make planes with enough American content if need be. I rebutted all these arguments with Jaymie (as you did with Pete), but we might be in the `power' phase with OSD on this issue. If anyone can talk sense to Aldridge, however, it's you.

Thus, to assume that it exists (wrong premise), and then to assume the Congress passed legislation which it didn't, and then to condemn ourselves in writing by stating the calculation based on a fantasy simply is crazy. It is a bureaucratic trick to make a fool out of Don as well as the Air Force. All this was ``resolved'' by Pete Aldridge before he left. To quote him: ``We need to go forward with DoD's position. If OMB wants to comment, let them.'' Point: we are running aground because PA&E; and OMB want me to sign a suicide note. BUT I WILL NOT. This whole drill has gotten out of hand! Jim. Dr. James G.

This is a footnote to a lengthy text, and offers a bone to the critics recently in Business Week who say that you and we tortured the economic argument to get what we want. I believe that addressing this point in this fashion takes the teeth out of their criticism. This will not embarrass at all the Secretary, as I would not even have considered it otherwise. This followed one full week of negotiation to remove it from the text and get it to only footnote status. My advice to you is to take the deal as written, sign it out of this Building--get the term waiver, and let the House and Senate proponents, do their magic.

Bogus because we DON'T HAVE THE $$$ NOW WITHOUT GIVING UP COMBAT CAPABILITY! This was Pete's argument. We turned to a lease because of this reality. The footnote to which you agreed?

Similarly, if blah blah, then the NPV would favor a lease by $$$.'' As this stands, it is embarrassing to you, me, and the Sec Def. Senator McCain and others who oppose the lease will leap to this number! Why is this so hard for you to see, Mike? Further, the footnote missed Pete Aldridge's point that this is a hypothetical since the Air Force doesn't have the BA to enter into such a multi year contract, even if the Congress bent its rules to do so without limited production! Marv, what do you think? Please get together with Mike to come up with a more palatable and balanced version of the footnote. Jim. Dr. James G. Roche, Secretary of the Air Force.

Thanks, Nancy. The Footnote is to the sentence that says: Applying the A- 94 test, it was determined that the net present value of the multi-year lease option and a traditional purchase option results in a NPV favoring a purchase of $150 million, as shown in Table 1[1]. Footnote: [1] In evaluating the net present value of the lease and purchase options as required by OMB Circular A-94, the Air Force relied on the availability of multi-year lease authority granted by Congress in 2002 Defense Appropriations Act. Had the Congress chosen instead to provide multi-year procurement authority the NPV could favor purchase by up to $1.9 billion. While this information affords a measure of clarity in an equitable comparison of terms and NPV, it is provided with the understanding that multiyear procurement authority was not available and therefore not a viable option for the Administration's analytical consideration.

CNBC will only use a small portion of what I said. For the record, though, here are the ten themes I told her, in some cases several times: (1) Tankers are essential enablers of American military power, and will become more so as our network of overseas bases continues to shrink. (2) Every bullet and bean America delivered to Afghanistan, not to mention every soldier and fighting system, got there on an airplane that had to be refueled in flight by a tanker. (3) This month marks the 45th anniversary of the first delivery of a KC-135 tanker to the Air Force, reflecting the fact that 90% of the tanker fleet has grown quite aged. (4) The fleet is so old that a third of airframes are in repair shops or waiting to go there on any given day. (5) The planes must be replaced, and the Air Force has determined that the Boeing 767 is the best aircraft to use. (6) Replacement of over 500 tankers may prove to be the biggest defense procurement program of this generation. (7) But even if we begin buying planes at the rate of two dozen per year, it will take the Air Force 20 years to replace the fleet--by which time some of the KC-135s will be at twice their design lives. (8) Flight hours is a useful indicator of airframe fatigue, but it tells you very little about the toll corrosion may be taking on the planes. (9) Leasing is a common practice among commercial airlines to mitigate the cost impact of acquiring large aircraft. (10) Senator McCain--the only critic of leasing in Congress--will not succeed in blocking a 767 lease because tanker replacement is critical and he has offered no alternative to leasing. Martha and I have actually had a number of conversations outside the taping, allowing me to repeat some core themes. She seems thoughtful and open-minded, with no axe to grind. Incidentally, I told her the lease was the exact opposite of a Boeing ``bailout''--it's a government attempt to get good terms from the company by taking advantage of a downturn in demand for commercial transports. 2004 Defense Planning Guidance directs a review of tanker replacement options, indicating the issue is now on OSD's radar screen.

Incidentally, I told her the lease was the exact opposite of a Boeing ``bailout''--it's a government attempt to get good terms from the company by taking advantage of a downturn in demand for commercial transports. 2004 Defense Planning Guidance directs a review of tanker replacement options, indicating the issue is now on the OSD's screen. From: Marvin Sambur SAF/AQ To: Jim Albaugh Date: June 17, 2003 Subj: FW: USAF Green Aircraft Pricing Jim: I have been working with Bob to answer a question from McCain concerning his claim that Continental received a better deal than the USAF. I asked Bob for a simple statement that, accounting for inflation and airworthiness directives, we received a better deal than anyone else. Given the assault that McCain is mounting on this deal (see attached) and our claims that we received the best deal, we need such a statement. Thanks! Marv. From: Bob Gower To: Marvin Sambur SAF/AQ Date: June 16, 2003 Subj: RE: USAF Green Aircraft Pricing We have the McCain request. I am traveling to DC in the morning for Hill visits the next few days. I will take your response up the chain. From: Marvin Sambur SAF/AQ To: Bob Gower CC: Arlene Marvin Date: June 16, 2003 Subj: Re: USAF Green Aircraft Pricing Bob: This is unacceptable. McCain will eat us for lunch. See attached. From: Bob Gower To: Sambur SAF/AQ Date: 6/16/2003 Subj: USAF Green Aircraft Pricing Marv: We looked at providing some type of certification for the ``green'' aircraft pricing and would prefer not to do this for two primary reasons. First, we have hurt our commercial airline market enough through the concessions, profit cap, and most favored customer clause. To provide an additional measure of certainty would set a new standard for the Boeing company that we prefer not to set. All elements of this deal are very visible and this would not be good for our other markets. Our best customers have understood the Most Favored Customer clause because some of them have seen these in the past but these have been forward looking with no commitment to historical pricing. Second, we believe Boeing providing additional commitments has little or no additional political benefit. I believe that if the USAF attempted to stand behind a Boeing statement that our enemies would unjustly attack Boeing's credibility. Therefore, my proposed solution is for the USAF to stand behind the facts which I see as: The USAF is confident we have received a most competitive price on the basic 767 aircraft. The USAF has ensured this through multiple means: (1) We obtained confidential information directly from a major airline that validates we obtained a very competitive price from a historical position, (2) We obtained a Most Favored Customer clause that protects the USAF on a going forward basis since it requires Boeing to refund the USAF should they ever sell a 767 for less than what the USAF paid, and (3) The USAF has capped Boeing's earnings to ensure the maximum profits they could [[Page S11784]] make are in line with DoD profit guidelines, insuring the USAF would benefit in the future should cost come in lower than predicted. Should cost be higher, Boeing bares the risk. With this firm, fixed price contract and Boeing responsible for all development costs, we believe this agreement is unprecedented in its protection for the taxpayer, and insure not only have we received the best pricing possible, but we will continue to obtain the best pricing from Boeing in the future. Regards, Bob. From: Marvin Sambur SAF/AQ To: Darleen Druyun SAF/AQ; James Roche SAF/OS Date: October 10, 2002 Subj: RE: Tanker Leasing Jamie Durnan stopped me this morning to tell me that OMB ``will fight us to the death on the lease.'' I asked why and he told me that they do not believe our numbers and their analysis shows that it is better to purchase. (At the leasing meeting the OMB number was about $50M favorable to purchase out of about $18B fly away cost.) I told him that we admit that the deal is probably a push but if we buy according to the same funding stream as leasing, we only get 6 tankers by 2009 versus 67 by leasing. The quicker delivery acts as an insurance policy against the unknown effects of aging and accelerating usage. He thought that was a compelling argument. Marv. From: Bill Essex SAF/AQQ To: Marvin Sambur SAF/AQ Date: August 03, 2002 Subj: FW: Potential OMB Problems with 767 Lease Sir: Our take on the OMB letter to Sen. McCain is below. Mr. Daniels went out of his way to slam 767 lease even though he does not really know much about it yet. Looks like an interesting fight shaping up. VR, Bill. From: Marvin Sambur To: James Roche Date: October 21, 2002 Subj: 767 meeting with OMB Boss: We spent three hours with Robin this AM going over the issues they highlighted for discussion and additional data. These topics were: Requirements justification, price of the green a/c, why our proposal meets the requirements of an operating lease and a better understanding of the legal ramifications of a Special Purpose Entity that would hold title to the tanker a/c. She was quite upset when she learned from the introductions that Boeing was present to answer any questions. When we saw her ``angst'' we told her they would leave or we could have an executive session with government only participants. She told us the damage was done and did not take up the options we outlined to her. We invited Boeing in to respond to questions she and her staff had and frankly they were very helpful in filling in some details and adding credibility. This was not a negotiation meeting and Boeing was only to provide answers on the pricing. I expect she will express to you her anger over Boeings presence. Robin and her staff asked for additional data which we are preparing to send over in the following read: What would the AF budget look like per FY to purchase the same number of aircraft being built and delivered under the lease? (The insurance argument of getting the lease tankers 5 years earlier with about the same net present value resonated with her. In addition, the point that Boeing will stop producing the 767 and if we delay, the price will rise considerable was also a strong argument to her.) However, they believe our price for the green a/c is too high and have asked for other large airline purchases, config and what the discount was from the list price. Apparently her staff made a bunch of phone calls and claim their number is lower than ours but she is the first to admit that she does not know the real validity behind them. We need to give them the maintenance costs of the 135s vs. The proposed 767 tankers. She will want a separate session on tanker termination liability issues. I believe we probably talked passed each other on this and I have directed my staff to prepare very clear charts on this to set the record straight. He also wants a copy of the draft contract T's and C's. In addition, she directed we rerun the numbers using a 6 years OMB discount rate in addition to the 15 year period. We have this and will give to them to OMB. I expect she will call you. We firmly believe the contractors attendance at the meeting was very helpful but she will probably blast us for it. We will keep you posted on our progress. From: Marvin Sambur To: James Roche Date: September 11, 2002 Subj: 767 Tanker justification Boss: I kicked off the effort to establish a ``need'' justification for the tankers. Hope to have a conceptual framework ready by the end of the week. Spoke to Robin after the meeting to tell her that the economic justification is not a slam dunk for either position (purchase or lease.) It is more a push and a slight change in the interest rates can flip the analysis. At the end of the day, we have to prove that there is a TRUE need and that there are other advantages to leasing (earlier delivery, affordability, etc) that make it a good business deal. It is going to be a tough sell given the other factors such as liability and indemnification. Marv.

From: Dov Zakheim To: Marvin Sambur Date: November 25, 2002 Subj: RE: KC-767 Lease Delay. I have a simple question? Where is the USAF money to fund this lease? From: Marvin Sambur To: Pete Aldridge; Dov Zakheim Date: November 22, 2003 Subj: KC-767 Lease Delay Pete and Dov: I understand the suggestion we delay the KC- 767 lease two years has come up again at high levels within OSD (though this time without necessarily paying to re-engine KC-135Es) in order to do a format AoA. As a follow-up to my recent e-mail on this subject: A formal AoA will cost money, delay the program two years, and still come up with the same answer we have today. There are only a few aircraft that can serve as tankers, they are already in production, and so analyzing their respective capabilities and costs won't take long--in fact, it's already been done and the results passed to OSD. What's left to study? For the last 45 days, OSD has had enough data to support a decision analysis--all they really need is the A-11/A-94 model we provided to determine that the deal is a good one. A complete contract is not required for OSD to analyze the lease; contracts are written to match the programs approved and justified through analysis; our A-11/A-94 model is the primary analytical tool upon which we are building our contract; if OSD analyzes the model (which we believe they have not done), they will be analyzing the proposed program. If restarted negotiations in 2005 resulted in a real price increase of just 5%, we will have to drop one aircraft per year to live within our budget. This will add further cost and stretch-out the KC-135 recapitalization effort two more years in addition to the two-year late start. A 5% price increase due to loss of negotiation leverage will add more than $700M to the cost of the first 100 KC- 767s. Bottom line: the penalty for delaying the lease we've negotiated today could be substantial even without the added burden of paying for maintaining KC-135Es. Please keep in mind that the low-cost deal we have today is the result of negotiating with a manufacturer suffering the impacts of an industry-wide downturn. That downturn is not expected to continue for another two years. As the facts show, our negotiating team got a better deal on these 767s than a major airline did with theirs with a 20-yr exclusive contract--we likely won't do as well when the industry recovers. How, then, would we explain this two-year delay to Congress? Marv. From: Michael Wynne To: Marvin Sambur Date: July 08, 2003 Subj: RE: Footnote Marv: At long last, this is the best that I could get-- relegating the non-available comparison to a footnote.

From: Marvin Sambur To: James Roche; Michael Wynne Date: July 08, 2003 Subj: Re: Footnote The primary reason for the lease is because it affords us the ability to recapitalize faster. By putting in the footnote, we allow our enemies to stall with the excuse that the AF should go to Congress and ask for a MYP. The OSD position is that the financials are a wash, so way cloud the issue and cause problems. Submit without the footnote and we will prevail.

Good work. How does our lease fare under the new circular? If it fails, then OMB may be in for an attack from Sen McCain. What dumb time to change the rules!!! JGR. Dr. James G. Roche, Secretary of the Air Force. From: Daniel Ramos To: James Roche CC: Marvin Sambur, William Hodges, Ty Hughes, Mary Walker, Janet Therianos Date: Aug 21, 2003 Subj: Revised OMB Circular A-11 Sir: Earlier this week Ms. Walker provided you with a copy of a revised version of OMB Circular A-11 issued on July 25, 2003. Among other things, the revised A-11 adds new guidelines for distinguishing between operating leases, capital lease the KC-767s requires that it be an operating lease based on the definition provided by OMB ``at the time of the lease.'' The statute does not state whether ``at the time of the lease'' means when the lease is signed or when it was first submitted to OMB for review, so it is possible that the revised A-11 could apply to the KC-767 transaction. We immediately engaged with OMB on this issue, and as of this afternoon OMB has verbally agreed to the following: OMB will issue a clarifying letter stating that the revised A-11 applies only to transactions approved by OMB after July 25, 2003. At our request, OMB will then issue a letter addressed to you stating that OMB approved the Air Force KC-767 transaction prior to July 25, 2003, and therefore the revised A-11 does not apply. OMB plans to issue the clarification early next week and the letter to the Air Force by the end of next week. If there is any change to this plan, we will let you know. From: Marvin Sambur To: James Roche Date: November 21, 2003 Subj: FW:767 Update FYI. From: Ty Hughes TO: Marvin Sambur CC: Scott Custer, Mary Walker, Daniel Ramos, Ted Bowlds Date: Nov 21, 2003 Subj: 767 Update Dr. Sambur: OMB General Counsel called DoD GC this afternoon and asked for a legislative proposal to address the obligation of funds for the tanker. OMB also asked what the Air Force can with respect to obligation of funds if there is no new legislation. DoD has prepared language that would allow obligation of funds upon delivery of the aircraft. The draft language would solve the problem. It should go over this evening. OMB is considering offering the language for inclusion in the Omnibus Appropriations Act. Without legislation, the DoD fiscal lawyer is still of the view that the Air Force must obligate all of the funds for purchase when the aircraft are ordered. We have scheduled meeting for 0900 on Monday with the DoD lawyers to discuss this. Ty Hughes. From: Mary Walker To: James Roche CC: John Jumper, Peter Teets, William Bodie, Janet Therlanos Date: Nov. 26, 2002 Subj: More Updates from GC Boss: Welcome back! (With the thought you are reading this after Thanksgiving . . .) Since I won't be here when you get in on Monday the 2nd (I'll be on my way to give a speech at the USAFE JAG conference . . .), I wanted you to have my long list of accumulated updates so you can be current with the issues we are working that are of known or suspected importance to you. Don Fox will be covering for me until I get back on Dec. 6th. This will fill you in. 767 Tanker Lease (legal issues): While most of the lease terms have been agreed upon, a number of terms have been elevated to SAF. The most important ones include the following: (1) A very significant issue just surfaced and may require us to obtain additional legislation. Boeing representatives told us the investors need assurance that the Air Force will not terminate the lease agreement while the aircraft are under the 3-year construction. We are concerned about the fiscal consequences of such an assurance since 40+ aircraft may be in various stages of construction at any one time. We are analyzing this issue under the limited statutory guidance for this program and past precedent, which is also limited because leasing of major systems has been so rare. FI we are unable to resolve this issue with the staff in DoD GC, we may need to seek another provision in law to provide adequate authority to meet our needs. (2) Boeing wants a clause advising the government of the tax treatment it wants reflected in the transaction. We have told them that the tax treatment is a matter between Boeing and the IRS, not the Air Force. [[Page S11786]] Boeing is considering whether to seek a Revenue Ruling or informal advice form the IRS. If they decide to go that route, we may want to ask the IRS to expedite consideration of their request. (3) The bond rating agency wants the government to agree not to initiate a bankruptcy petition against the lessor until one year and a day after the final lease payment. While we understand this is a standard provision in commercial aircraft lease, DOJ, not the Air Force, decides when to file documents (such as bankruptcy petitions). We will ask Boeing to discuss this matter with the bond rating agency to see if they can make an exception for a government lessee or lese tailor the clause in a way that would not bind DOJ. If not, we will work the issue with Justice. (4) Boeing also wants indemnification under Public Law 85- 804 for ``unusually hazardous risks.'' You approved such indemnification in the case of the 737 lease. However, Boeing's request is now broader and the company seeks indemnification for the lender and officers of the various entities involved. The Air Force has not provided such broad indemnification in the past. We are currently reviewing whether we have the legal authority to do this and then there is the policy issue of whether this is something we want to consider. We also are working on the definition of unusually hazardous risk in this case. From: Michael Wynne To: James Roche Date: June 24, 2003 Subj: Meeting Jim: Thanks for hosting on Tankers--flavor just right, but I may need to borrow that reverse flak jacket yet. Best, Mike. From: Michael Wynne To: James Roche Date: July 17, 2003 Subj: Good Luck Jim: I wanted to say again congrats to get to the next phase fight on Tankers, likely less than the fight so far. Good Luck as well on the nom and confirm process. I'll be somewhere behind you. President willing. Best, Mike. From: Michael Wynne TO: Nancy Spruill, Ronald Sega, William Porter CC: Richard Wiersema; Raymond Jones; Robert Nemetz Date: November 01, 2003 Subj: RE: Two Issues--Tankers and Ship Funding I think I responded but if not--I thought we could support two R&D; ships if in different yards, and so stretch R&D; a little. Incremental for production would be a stretch. Tankers--aaaaarrrrgggghhh!!! enough said. Best, Mike. From: Nancy Spruill To: Michael Wynne; Ronald Sega; William Porter CC: Richard Wiersema; Raymond Jones; Robert Nemetz Date: November 1, 2003 Subj: RE: Two Issues--Tankers and Ship Funding Mike: This evening Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, Dr. Sega, Marv Sambur, Dave Patterson, Dan Stanley and I met with Joel Kaplan and others from OMB/WH/VP's office. The issue was a legislative strategy for the way ahead on the tanker lease, in light of the proposed Warner amendment/ press articles/interactions with Congress/etc. There was a lot of support to go with the amendment but AF argued that there were other players--HASC and appropriators--so we should let the process work its way out. Dr. Wolfowitz raised the issue of a compromise and asked for an additional 28 hours to get a Department position to Joel Kaplan. Dave Patterson will have the lead and Ron Sega and I will work w/him. They are aware of your recommendation about where to get offsets, if we went with 20/80. From: James Roche To: Paul Weaver Sent: May 21, 2002 Subject: (No subject) Thanks, Paul. You are correct re KC-767's. Let's wait until we have a deal. We just completed negotiations on the four 737's for Congressional travel. Re F-22's, the ANG is welcome to make the following points: (1) The F-22 is needed, and will be a formidable weapon system. (2) It will be important for the ANG to be part of this program. (3) If the program is cut, the chance to put F-22's in the Guard effectively will evaporate. Be well. Jim. From: Paul Weaver To: James Roche Sent: May 21, 2002 Subject: (No subject) Mr. Secretary: I just returned on Monday from the Adjutants General's conference in Boise. Great turnout and great support for our Air Force. Gen Kane and Killey briefed them on their meeting with you and all voiced overwhelming approval to help out in AF modernization where ever they can. Led by the TAG from Arizona, who's Phoenix unit flies the oldest KC-135E's, want to start working the Hill for support for the KC-767. They do not want Sen. McCain to hurt the proposal. They want to get out the straight facts on the old E's. I advised them to hold off until a deal is finally cut between the AF and Boeing. I want to make sure that that is still your position. They will all respect your wishes and will move out when you give the signal to do so. They also want to do whatever it takes to keep the F-22's in production and have the ANG as part of it. Danny did a great job and I'm sure he will do well in the future as the Director. God Bless, Paul. From: Burkhardt & Associates To: James Roche Sent: May 3, 2002 Subject: WSJ Not very helpful article this morning. Here's the short outside the beltway reaction. (If you want the long version, give me a call)-- (1) Why the secrecy of your Wall street advisors? I think you got lousy legal advice on that memo. (If the article is accurate and you're using Wall Street advisors). You're the client. I can't envision a circumstance under which whoever is structuring this deal for you wants the fact that their doing so is kept quiet. It's red meat to Congress to tell them they can't know something. (2) Claiming confidentiality is like claiming executive privilege. Even if it's correct in a narrow technical sense (and I'm not at all convinced it is) it only hurts you-- larger public case. You can't defeat the claims that you're not disclosing something (by implication--something bad) (esp from someone as visible as McCain) without real information. I'd distribute a one page memo saying the per plane cost of the lease will not be greater than x and have x be less than the last lease Boeing did for some commercial entity--or that x is y dollars less than the cost of a new tanker.

From: Dr. Marvin Sambur To: James Roche Sent: April 9, 2002 Subject: RE: Call from Boeing Boss: Gerry Daniels called to discuss the tankers. He started the conversation by reminding me that McCain was a minority view and if the AF brought the deal forward it would easily pass. I stated that the AF would not bring this forward unless it was a good deal. Apparently, he never took this message seriously as he was surprised at this response. I explained our business model and indicated that if Boeing could not fir into this model we would shake hands and disengage. I arranged to have him and his team share our model. I ended the conversation by telling him that the AF's reputation was at stake and we are committed to getting a good deal or else there would be no deal. Boeing must take some risks given the future value of this initial contract. We are pointed towards an end of May conclusion as to whether to disengage. Marv.

JGR. From: Marvin Sambur To: James Roche Sent: December 13, 2001 Subject Fw: 767 lease Yesterday, I was asked to prepare an enhanced point paper on the 767 lease for the Vice. The number that was given to me from AQ on this enhanced paper were different from those developed for the point paper prepared for you. I questioned these numbers and received fuzzy answers in return. I decided to do the calculation myself using an excel spreadsheet. I found to my dismay that the numbers were correct according to the OMB definitions but very misleading in a true financial sense. The deal was not good from a true financial basis and I briefed the Vice at 7:30PM of the misleading nature of the numbers and advised my people that we needed to get a better deal from Boeing to make this financially attractive. Nelson Gibbs reached the same conclusions. I need to make sure that in the future our financial calculations are both accurate and business based. I am sorry for not catching this sooner! Marv.

However, the early conference report language looked to me like it contains all we need to proceed. We are just going to have to wait until later today to see how this turns out. My gut feel is that each document was written for precise reasons (to pacify certain factions) and that ultimately we will be able to execute the lease/buy as we want it done. It also looks like we are only going to be able to retire 12 vs 44 135E's in FY)$ . . . even after all of our attempts to engage the Hill on this I'm not surprised as this is really a BRAC optics issue.

The Air Force needs to replace these aircraft, and the FY2002 bill began that process.\nBoeing has proposed that the Air Force lease these aircraft based on the 767 in a commercial type arrangement. The proposal would allow the Air Force to lease 100 tankers, to replace 136 aging Boeing KC-135E aircraft, at a cost of $20 million per plane per year under a 10-year lease arrangement.\nEquipped with both the proven Boeing-developed boom-and-receptacle and the hose-and-drogue aerial refueling systems, the 767 Tanker/Transport offers maximum operational flexibility along with full European Union and NATO interoperability.

While maintaining its tanker capability, the aircraft's uninterrupted cabin floor can be configured for: Passenger; Freighter; Convertible (passenger or freighter); and Combi (passenger and freighter).\nThe 767 Tanker/Transport is a low-risk solution that brings to bear the unique capabilities of the world leaders in tanker design and integration: The Boeing Company and Alenia Aerospazio/Aeronavali, which together have almost 2,000 new-production tankers and tanker modifications to their credit.

The Boeing Co. yesterday said it believes Sears acted alone, and that no other Boeing officials participated in any wrongdoing. But Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, an independent interest group that has been closely following the case, said Sears \"has to have information that is reasonably important to the U.S. attorney.\" \"Mr. Sears would not have gotten such a generous plea agreement if he had not made a generous proffer\" to help prosecutors pursue their case, said Boehm, a former prosecutor. Sears' plea to a single felony count of aiding and abetting illegal employment negotiations could bring him a prison term of five years. But his attorney, as well as independent observers, believe the 57-year-old Sears is likely to serve far less. Sears' attorney, James Streicker, told U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Lee that federal sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of zero to six months in jail. Sears' fate won't be known until he is sentenced Jan. 21, but the public suggestion that he could face a relatively light term prompted speculation that he has agreed to share valuable information to federal prosecutors in their ongoing investigations into Boeing and Pentagon contracting practices. The nature of Sears' offer was not disclosed yesterday and U.S. Attorney Paul McNulty declined to elaborate on the information Sears might provide. But with Sears' plea, and a separate plea in April by Druyun, prosecutors investigating procurement corruption have at their disposal two of the most senior officials involved in some of the most expensive acquisitions in recent years. \"Sears' secret employment negotiations ... struck at the heart of the integrity of the multibillion-dollar defense acquisition process. Conflict-of-interest rules are important and protect the public interests,\" McNulty said. Sears admitted that he offered Druyun, 56, of Vienna, Va., who was one of the Air Force's top contract officers, a $250,000 executive position at Boeing while she was reviewing whether Boeing should get a $23 billion contract to provide new refueling tankers to the Air Force. Druyun, who was sentenced in October to nine months in prison, has previously admitted that she provided an inflated price to Boeing on the contract as \"a parting gift\" and that she had helped Boeing obtain inflated deals on previous contracts, while at the same time she intervened to get her daughter a job at the company and later to keep her from being fired by Boeing for poor performance. The tanker contract has been cancelled, though Boeing and its allies believe the company will eventually win the contract again though in a different fashion. Yesterday's plea, said Keith Ashdown, vice president for the non-partisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, \"makes it crystal clear that Sears is cooperating with the prosecution and will be able to offer investigators a proverbial road map to who knew what and when.\" With Druyun and Sears providing information, prosecutors \"will be off to the races,\" Boehm said, adding that Druyun and Sears will be used to look \"up, not down\" the ranks of the company and Pentagon. At the very least, Sears will help investigators learn \"who knows\" specific information within the organizations. Prosecutors have not said exactly what their target is, but some independent observers believe all of Boeing's major contracts with the military branches over the past several years could be reviewed, including an Army contract that alone could earn Boeing more than $100 billion. As chief financial officer, Sears was at the heart of Boeing's most senior executives, including former Chief Executive Phil Condit and James Albaugh, head of defense programs. Boeing, however, dismissed suggestions that other senior executives had knowledge of the negotiations. Boeing General Counsel Doug Bain, in a statement yesterday, said Sears' plea did nothing to dent the company's assertion that Sears' acted alone. Boeing officials, Bain said, believed that Sears was following appropriate laws and ethics guidelines in his deliberations with Druyun. \"The Boeing company will continue to provide any information requested in the ongoing review of Druyun-related procurements and to take appropriate action to finally resolve this matter,\" Bain said. Sears' journey from an ambitious Boeing executive who once was considered a candidate to replace CEO Condit to an admitted felon had its start in September 2002 when Druyun's daughter, Heather, sent Sears \"an unsolicited encrypted e-mail.\" The subject line said, \"Please do not forward ... RE: Darleen Druyun.\" Heather was able to e-mail Sears because he helped arrange a job for her in the company's St. Louis operation in November 2000. According to court documents, Heather Druyun served as the go-between, advising Sears on the type of position her mother was interested in filling after retiring from the Air Force. The job, Heather e-mailed Sears on Sept. 5, 2002, \"must be challenging, tough, lots of responsibility. Does not want something that puts her on display.\" Druyun's daughter advised Sears in the same e-mail that her mother was also talking to Lockheed Martin, Boeing's biggest rival, and that Darleen Druyun was impressed with Lockheed's proposal. \"She is very interested in talking to us,\" Druyun's daughter continued in the Sept. 5 e-mail, \"but we would have to give her something that would blow her out of the water!\" The note concluded by saying that Druyun was fond of Boeing. \"She also mentioned that Boeing has her most admired quality: honest values.\" The series of e-mails eventually led Sears to meet Darleen Druyun in Orlando, Fla., on Oct. 17, 2002, to discuss a job with Boeing, even though she was barred from such talks because she was still handling negotiations on the tanker contract. Sears outlined a senior job in Washington, D.C., that would pay $250,000 a year and a signing bonus of $50,000. A day after the meeting in Orlando, Sears sent an e-mail to Albaugh and \"three other members of the office of the chairman\" summarizing the meeting. \"Howdy. Had a 'non-meeting' yesterday re: hiring Jim Evatt's deputy. Good reception to job, location, longer-term outlook. Recommend we put together a formal offer.\" Druyun resigned from the Air Force Nov. 5, 2002, and began working for Boeing on Jan. 2, 2003. By then Druyun had learned of a Boeing investigation into her hiring and tried to cover up the series of events, especially the Oct. 17 meeting. She and Sears were fired in November 2003. Condit resigned a week later.

Congress killed a leasing aspect of the deal in a defense authorization bill last month in response to a growing scandal centering on a former Air Force official who admitted giving special treatment to Boeing on the tanker deal and other contracts.\nThe official, Darleen Druyun, later joined Boeing as a top executive. She has pleaded guilty on felony charges and was sentenced to nine months in prison. Boeing's former chief financial officer, Michael Sears, has also pleaded guilty for his role in hiring Druyun.\nDeputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said in a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., that the department is studying a wide range of alternatives before proceeding on the tanker deal.\n\"After we have selected an appropriate alternative, we intend to require competition,\" Wolfowitz wrote. \"No matter which alternative we choose, leasing is not an option without new congressional authority.\"\nWolfowitz's letter, published Saturday in the Congressional Record, was hailed as good news by critics who contend the original deal was structured in Boeing's favor.\n\"Competition doesn't mean Boeing doesn't get the contract. It just means taxpayers will get more bang for their buck,\" said Keith Ashdown, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.\nBoeing said it respected the Pentagon's decision and looked forward to the competition. European-based EADS, which owns most of Boeing rival Airbus, is expected to be the main competitor for the tanker deal.\n\"Backed by our 50 years of tanker expertise, the Boeing 767 tanker has already been selected by Italy and Japan,\" said Boeing spokesman Doug Kennett. He said the Italian Air Force's first full-up 767 tanker will roll out in February and fly in March of next year.\nRalph Crosby, chairman and chief executive officer of EADS North America, said that if there is a competition for the tankers, his company will participate.\n\"We will team with a major American partner, expand our industrial footprint in the United States, employ American workers and pledge to offer the finest military capability for the United States Air Force at the best value to our taxpayers,\" Crosby said.\nWolfowitz's letter, dated Friday, essentially accepts an interpretation of the defense authorization bill offered by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., an Armed Services Committee member and fierce critic of the tanker deal. McCain said the bill brings the Air Force's plan \"back to square one\" with a \"full and open competition\" required.\nSupporters of the tanker deal had disputed that, saying the defense bill merely killed the leasing aspect of the original deal, which called for Boeing to supply 100 of the 767 planes for use as tankers.\nIn a Senate floor speech last week, McCain released a series of internal Pentagon e-mails that he said show \"a systemic Air Force failure in procurement oversight, willful blindness or rank corruption\" in pursuit of the Boeing deal.", "title": "Boeing : Pentagon Says It Will Open Tanker Deal To Competition", "url": "http://www.komotv.com/boeing/story.asp?ID=34087", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041123120557/http://www.komotv.com/boeing/story.asp?ID=34087"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "SEC. RUMSFELD: Good afternoon. To any who might question the transformative power of freedom, we witnessed it last week in a visit to Latin America. Not so many decades ago, a number of the countries in that region were traumatized by civil war and/or dictatorships. Today they are mostly peaceful democracies. Factions that previously took up arms now seek to influence through the battle box -- ballot box.\nLatin America's successes should give heart, I think, to those that are seeking freedom in Iraq. The coming months in Iraq will be crucial, to be sure. Elections are now set for January 30th, less than 10 weeks from now, and that will offer the diverse groups in the country, minority and majority groups, an unprecedented opportunity to settle disputes as part of a political process rather than by force of arms. Most Iraqis are embracing this opportunity with some enthusiasm. Reports are that already some 200 Iraqi political parties and individuals are registering to compete in the elections.\nOf course, for democracy to succeed, areas of the country cannot remain under control of insurgents, regime holdovers, extremists and foreign terrorists. At the request of the interim Iraqi government, Iraqi security personnel and coalition forces have been freeing Fallujah and other areas from the murderous enemies of progress.\nOperations in Fallujah and elsewhere demonstrate anew the extremism of those opposing Iraqi democracy. Over the past two weeks, a single military unit found 191 weapons caches, and 431 improvised explosive devices in one sector of Fallujah alone. Soldiers and Marines have found large IED-making facilities, and facilities for making vehicle-borne bombs. They have discovered torture rooms, including one that had a human-size wire cage, and others with bloody handprints on the wall. And 66 of 77 mosques that have been inspected by Iraqi forces in Fallujah were being used to store weapons and to conduct their terror campaigns against the people of Fallujah and against coalition forces.\nNo doubt attacks will continue in the weeks and months ahead, and perhaps intensify as the Iraqi election approaches. I suppose this has to be expected. The extremists have a lot to lose, and Iraq was a violent place long before its liberation. But if the coalition is steadfast, and it will be, eventually we will see the last vestiges of this dying order fade away.\nPredictably we're hearing from those who say the Iraqis cannot pull off a transition to democracy -- can't be done. Let them tell that to the people of Afghanistan who braved the threats and violence to elect their first democratic president, or to the people of Asia or Eastern Europe, or Latin America, for that matter. History has shown in most every region of the world, when people are given a chance to rule their own lives, they seize it. And why should we believe that the people of Iraq will choose any differently?\nOne final note. As our country prepares to celebrate Thanksgiving, we will take time to remember the truly outstanding men and women in uniform who continue to bring the hope of freedom to millions around the world. We thank them. We thank their families and their loved ones. And we will particularly remember the families and loved ones of those who have given their lives in service to our country and those in hospitals, whether in Germany or here in the Washington area or elsewhere around our country, who are recovering from their wounds. They will all be in our thoughts and prayers.\nGeneral Myers.\nGEN. MYERS: Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and good afternoon.\nLet me just add on to what the secretary just said. I want to express the condolences of all the joint chiefs of staff to those who have been killed or wounded, to their families, their loved ones, their friends, over this entire global war on terrorism. As the secretary said, they're doing what they do so we can live in this country, our friends and allies can live in peace and freedom. So we owe them a real debt of gratitude, and we will remember them, especially as this holiday season progresses.\nI recently returned from a trip to Iraq and Europe. I visited with General Abizaid, General Casey in Baghdad, General Metz in Baghdad and leadership in Fallujah. I also met with Prime Minister Allawi and members of his cabinet. There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that the Iraqi people, from the senior government leaders to the average citizen, recognize the importance of their role and their mission in creating a free Iraq. We continue to take the battle to the enemy. Fallujah is no longer a terrorist stronghold. Iraq and multinational forces will continue to pursue terrorists and criminals throughout Iraq to improve security and pave the way for the January 30th elections.\nDuring my visit to Iraq, several things became clear. The first, since I hadn't visited before the interim Iraqi government was installed, the biggest difference was just seeing Iraqis taking more charge of their own destiny, particularly Iraqi security forces. And we saw that in Fallujah and we saw it in the north Babil area just south of Baghdad.\nWe also saw that intimidation is becoming the preferred tactic of the enemy. The horrific murder of Margaret Hassan and other brutal slayings demonstrate the insurgents' determination to go to absolutely any length to prevent Iraqis from stepping forward to assume critical roles at all levels of government. Yet courageous Iraqis continue to volunteer to serve in the Iraqi government, and their leadership is absolutely key to their success in Iraq. The preponderance of enemy forces are, we think, former regime elements who will stop at nothing to prevent a free and democratic Iraq, yet they have no alternative solution except to rule by terror and by fear.\nOur troops are performing magnificently across the board. Every day our troops are bravely facing the enemy, and they understand the importance of their mission, and their morale is high. As elections draw near, and as they have continuously since the start of this conflict, our leaders on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to look at force levels necessary to ensure safe elections can take place. As we flush out insurgents in places such as Fallujah, it is important to have the appropriate force levels to maintain a secure environment.\nMake no mistake: The insurgents will continue to employ, in my view, inhuman tactics as they attempt to disrupt the elections. Let me assure you, though, the Iraqi people and the coalition have the will and the determination to prevail.\nAnd with that, we'll take your questions.\nSEC. RUMSFELD: Charlie?\nQ Mr. Secretary, in an administration that prizes solidarity, have you and the senior civilian and military leadership in this building been working behind the scenes on the Hill to torpedo the Senate intelligence bill? And what are your objections to that bill, sir?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: Well, Charlie, I think you probably know me well enough to know I wouldn't be doing that. The fact that the New York Times editorial says that I'm obviously lobbying against the President's stated policy is nonsense.\nI was asked by the White House to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee well before the president established a complete position on intelligence reform. He had come out in favor of the NID and in favor of the NCTC. I went up and testified and supported the NID and the NCTC, and then gave my personal views, which I said were not administration views.\nSomewhat later, a week or two or three, again, well before the President adopted a specific position on some of the details, I was asked to brief the intelligence -- in the intelligence room in the Senate on Iraq, and in the House. Dick Myers and I went and did that. Again, I was asked my views; I supported the President's position. At that point he had elaborated one more point, and that was that he wanted to make sure that we did not interfere with the chain of command, in addition to supporting the NID and the NCTC. That's been my position.\nThe New York Times is wrong. The congressmen who are saying that I had blatant opposition to the bill is incorrect because the bill didn't exist in the form that it currently is, and the President didn't have a position on the bill at the times that I was briefing him.\nNeedless to say, I'm a part of this administration. I support the President's position. And I haven't been close to it because I've been out of the country, but my impression is that the -- that it looks close; it looks like the House and Senate are having a typical conference where you have a lot of differences, and they've been sorting through those and kind of working their way along. And my impression is that without question, I favor reform in the intelligence community, as the President does. And I have a feeling that they're close.\nQ Mr. Secretary, some members of the House Intelligence Committee say that the Senate version of the bill doesn't protect tactical intelligence from the warfighter because it concentrates too much on overall intelligence. Would you agree with that, sir?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: No, I'm not knowledgeable enough to agree or disagree. I am supporting the President's position. I am a part of his administration.\nThe difficulty, I suppose, that comes up is the same piece of information can simultaneously be tactical battlefield information and at the same time be national intelligence. We all know that. These things don't fall into neat bins where they're one or the other. So this is tough stuff. This is hard work to do what they're doing up there, and my impression is that the legislative process is working its way.\nQ General Myers, can you explain --\nQ Mr. Secretary, following up on that --\nQ General Myers, can you explain the circumstances of your letter to Congressman Hunter, which does appear to lend support to one version of the bill over the other.\nGEN. MYERS: You bet. When senior officers go before the Senate Armed Services Committee to be confirmed, one of the things they ask you, would you be willing to provide your personal opinion if it differs from that of the administration on whatever matter. And, of course, you tell them yes, you will. And that was the situation --\nSEC. RUMSFELD: If you want to be confirmed! (Laughs; laughter.)\nGEN. MYERS: Only if you want to be confirmed!\nAnd Chairman Hunter called and asked for my opinion on a certain matter that related to intel reform, and I was obliged to give him my opinion, and I did that.\nQ Mr. Secretary, were you aware General Myers was sending a letter opposing -- raising serious concerns about the bill?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: Not only was I, but the White House was. I mean, we had discussed this matter internally. They knew our positions, the White House. And it had been as things evolved, people were opining on this and talking about that. And they were fully aware of the chairman's position, just as I was. And we also were fully aware of the requirement that a uniformed military personnel when they're asked by the House or the Senate committee's their views would give them their honest views, and he did.\nQ So just to be straight, you did support the legislation that was blocked this weekend?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: I support the president's position. What they're in is a very complicated negotiation up there, and they're trying to resolve a series of final four, five, six items, as I understand it. As I say, I haven't been involved in it, I've been out of the country. But the President's position is evolving as the negotiation evolves. I'm a part of this administration. If I didn't want to support the President's position, I wouldn't be in the administration, and I do intend to support it.\nQ And Charlie's question, did you lobby anybody behind the scenes on it?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: And the answer is absolutely not, and it's just plain inaccurate to say, as The New York Times editorial does, that I have. (Inaudible.)\nQ Do you agree with the chairman's letter?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: I did exactly what I said I did. I testified at the request of the White House prior to the time the president had a position on all the details. I didn't want to. I said I thought it was not a good idea to testify until the President and the administration had a position. I went up there at their request and I did testify and I did tell the truth and said what I thought, and it's a matter of public record.\nQ Do you agree with the chairman's letter?\nQ General Myers?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: Why don't we -- why don't we get it to the other side?\nQ General Myers, to sort of attempt to cut to the bottom line here, subsequent --\nSEC. RUMSFELD: You don't think we gave you the bottom line?\nQ Not just yet. (Laughter.) Subsequent to the President stating his position on intelligence reform you wrote the letter, and the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff last Thursday, when requested, told the House Armed Services Committee that they supported your position. So now can you tell us, yourself and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, do you still oppose -- and Mr. Secretary also -- do you gentlemen still oppose shifting budget authority and appropriations and responsibility for the NSA, the NRO and the Geospatial Agency from the Pentagon, the Department of Defense, over to a national intelligence director? Are you opposed to that? Is that your best military advice to the Congress?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: The answer for me, I support the President's position, and it's one that's evolving as those complex details are being worked out as to what that set of relationships ought to be.\nQ Sir, with all due respect, that is the language in the bill at the moment. Do you --\nSEC. RUMSFELD: Well, you can't say that because there are -- there's a debate over what will go in that bill and there are differing positions.\nQ That's the language in the bill that was not supported over the weekend by -- did not come to a vote in Congress. So my question, very precisely, still stands for both of you. Mr. Chairman, did you and the Joint Chiefs still oppose shifting those programs to a national intelligence director?\nGEN. MYERS: My position on the particular issue is as stated in my letter. And the Joint Chiefs can speak for themselves, and I guess they did in a hearing last week when I was gone.\nSEC. RUMSFELD: Yes?\nGEN. MYERS: Haven't changed.\nQ Mr. Secretary, Secretary Wolfowitz has told Chairman Warner that there will be a competition now on whatever future alternative is determined to take for a tanker recapitalization or new tankers. Can you say with certainty that the Air Force can oversee a fair competition, given the recent revelation of Secretary Roche's e-mails that personally attack EADS CEO Ralph Crosby?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: I was out of town. I was told about Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz's letter. I certainly agree with it. And that will be the policy of the department.\nQ Do you think the Air Force can run a fair competition given that there is a revealed position here that the Air Force leadership has a personal problem with Ralph Crosby?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: I don't know anything about that part of your question. What I can tell you is this: There is a law, and the Department of Defense will adhere to the law, and that is not a complicated thing to do. We will do that. And the law specifies what it is we should do, and we will do that.\nQ Mr. Secretary --\nQ Which law are you referring to?\nQ Mr. Secretary, within the hour, SACEUR General Jimmy Jones at the National Press Club talked about one of your favorite topics, transformation, but he also said that soon a NATO training team of two (thousand) to 3,000 members will begin training parts of the Iraqi security force, but he also said one of the problems with this transformation is that up to 11 NATO countries would not take part. Do you feel NATO can still be relevant if all its members don't take part in military action?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: Well, I've been around a lot of years involving NATO, and I've heard the \"NATO may be irrelevant\" charge leveled probably every two or three years for the last 30 years. And lo and behold, NATO has survived. It is not a single-headed organization; it's a consensus organization today involving some 26 nations -- up from 15 when I was over there. And that means there's always going to be a give and a take and a tug and a pull.\nNow, is it a problem? Yes. Let me explain why this issue that General Jones raised is a problem. If you have headquarters and units and the 26 countries assign people to those units and those headquarters on the basis that when NATO decides to do something the NATO countries will then do that, and then all of a sudden one or two countries raise their hand and say: \"Wait a minute. We agreed that NATO could do it, but we're not going to let our people in those headquarters do it,\" now that's a problem. And that's a problem that the ambassador there is working on; it's a problem the secretary- general's working on.\nI mean, it's kind of like if you've got a basketball team, and you have five people trained together week after week after week. Comes to be game time and two of them stick up their hand and say, \"Gee, I don't think I'm going to play this week.\" It would be better if they were on the bench and somebody else had been training for the last period of weeks. And so that's something that NATO's going to have to work on.\nQ Mr. Secretary --\nQ Question for General Myers. Mr. Secretary, a question for General Myers. You just came back from Iraq. We continue to hear reports that some field commanders feel like they need more troops. We read them. We see them. You were there. Did anyone ever raise that issue with you? I understand no official requests have been made, and if they are, troops will be coming forward. But is there any indication from anyone you talked to over there that they feel they could use more troops, they need more troops? And can we expect something like that in the future?\nGEN. MYERS: We were trying to look -- when I was over there discussing with the commanders, I did meet with the 1st Cavalry Division commander and the Marines out in Fallujah and the 24 MEU down in north Babil. So I didn't see all the commanders; I saw that group. And I talked to General Metz, as I said, and General Casey. And we talked in general terms about troop requirements.\nAnd when we think about troop requirements, let's just not focus on the United States of America. Obviously, we're a big part of the troop-contributing nations over there, but Iraq would be next and the coalition would be after that. And so we've got to think it in that whole context.\nSo we talked about all those issues. We talked about how the insurgency might develop over the next few months, the next couple of months as we march towards elections, and what kind of security might be required and what help Iraqi security forces might need and the Iraqi government might need to provide that support. So we did talk about that.\nAnd as you recall, Fallujah operations were still continuing at that point, and a lot of force had been sent to the Fallujah area and some of that had not gone back to where it came from. So I think part of what we heard was colored by that.\nBut as I mentioned in my opening statement, this is something that commanders over there continually review. The commanders I talked to would bring it up through General Metz and General Casey and General Abizaid, and they would make some evaluation of what is appropriate, and they would bring it forward here to the Pentagon. And --\nSEC. RUMSFELD: But as you know, we will have more troops because the Iraqi security forces are going up, and we've decided to overlap some troops during the election period. So you're going to have additional troops during that period from both of those two sources.\nBob?\nQ Mr. Secretary --\nSEC. RUMSFELD: Bob.\nQ Yes. I'd like to ask you a question about once you get to the election on January 30th and beyond, does that open the opportunity then to begin to withdraw American forces from Iraq? And at the same time, how will you know when the time has arrived that Iraqi forces are capable of handling the security task on their own?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: I mean, General Myers hit it on the nose. The answer is that the security situation on the ground is going to determine whether or not you increase or decrease troops or leave them where they are, knowing that during this period the Iraqi security forces are coming up.\nAnd we just had a briefing this morning from General Casey and General Abizaid, and the report on the units of Iraqi forces that have been involved in Fallujah and elsewhere during this period have been generally pretty good, and that they've performed well. There were some instances where it was not perfect, but pretty good. And they're -- I think the feeling is that they're gaining confidence in particularly a number of the units of the Iraqi security forces.\nSo I'm -- I mean, my feeling is that what we'll see after the elections, at least what I hope we'll see, is that the Iraqi people participate fully, as they did in Afghanistan; that they feel that they have a stake in the future of that country; that the level of violence that we expect to increase between now and then, through that period, is at a level that is -- nonetheless permits the elections to take place. I was very pleased with the pronouncements of the Iraqi government saying that they wanted the elections, they intend to have the elections, and they intend to have them everywhere, despite the fact that it's uneven from a security standpoint. Time will tell. We'll see what happens.\nYes?\nQ Sir, in terms of the Iraqi security forces --\nQ General --\nSEC. RUMSFELD: Oh, excuse me.\nGEN. MYERS: Let me just say, just one minute.\nAfghanistan is not a bad model, I mean -- and I don't know if it's a perfect model, but what happened there after elections for the presidency was that many of the Taliban, as we're finding out, are now considering their options and looking more toward political participation as opposed to terrorism as an activity. Pretty significant. But that's sort of how that's developing.\nAnd I think elections in Iraq are going to be one more step on the path towards a stable and secure and a democratic Iraq. It won't be the final step, but it will allow us to start then looking at, if events dictate, how we can rearrange ourselves, the coalition, and Iraqi forces, for that matter. It -- again, in my trip there, the Iraqi performance of the forces, the several thousand they had in Fallujah, they have a unit in north Babil that operates with our 24 MEU very effectively -- remarkable integration of forces. And as they build up the forces, as they build up particularly the leadership of those forces at the colonel and general officer level, and so forth, then I think we can anticipate them being able to handle more of their own affairs. And that, of course, is, in the end, going to be the goal.\nQ General Myers?\nQ You talk about these particular units have performed well. Overall, are the Iraqi security forces on schedule? Are you today where you thought you would be in terms of numbers, and more importantly, quality of Iraqi security forces?\nGEN. MYERS: I think generally we're on track with where we want to be. What we measure today are those trained and those equipped, and that's working pretty well. I mean, there are some cultural differences between how armies behave and what they expect, and so forth, that people have to get used to; for instance, when troops like to take leave and what they expect in terms of their terms of service. Those will be worked through.\nThe point that we need to continue to focus on is a very serious point, is the leadership issue. And if you want -- and this is universal; it doesn't matter what culture you're in. But if you want performance out of people, if you want loyalty out of people, if you want people under hardship to perform and to stick to it, then good leadership is one of the ingredients -- one of the key ingredients -- and that's what we have to work.\nQ (Off mike) -- people I've talked to is that those units that have Americans embedded or advisers are doing better than those that don't. Do you have a breakdown of how many have embedded American advisers and --\nGEN. MYERS: We do. I don't happen to have it with me. And that's another potential way ahead, by the way, and we've done that in many places around the world, where we'll put a few people with a unit and they can bring them training skills, the mentoring and intelligence fusion, operational planning capabilities that could be very helpful.\nYes?\nQ Mr. Secretary, I had a quick question -- a follow-up on the Boeing issue. You got a letter on Friday from Senators Warners, Levin and McCain asking for an expanded management accountability review of the whole tanker issue, including current and former DOD and Air Force employees. What's your take? Should such a broad review be launched?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: My understanding is that a letter came in. I don't know if it was to me or the deputy.\nQ (Off mike.)\nSEC. RUMSFELD: But it -- the deputy took it, met with the inspector general, reviewed what the inspector general has already done, reviewed what they have under way, and discussed with him what remains to be completed. And a response based on that meeting and based on the work that the IG has done will be going back to them, as I understand it. Needless to say, it's a -- the -- I'd rather have the deputy give you the precise details, because I wasn't in the meeting.\nQ As the leader of the department, are you concerned that there's this perception that one person, one Air Force official, is able to take billions of dollars of procurement -- that's what the senators ask. They ask how could one person have done this?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: I've spent time thinking about that, and as a matter of fact, I wrote down some thoughts about it. It's interesting. I'm not going to have the facts correct, so I won't try to give you numbers. But she was -- let's for the sake of argument say she was there for a 10-year period, roughly, that spanned a couple or three, two or three administrations. She was a civilian deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for acquisition, was her title. There was also a military deputy undersecretary for acquisition, and above her was an assistant secretary for acquisition and a secretary of the Air Force, and then off to the side is the undersecretary for acquisition and logistics and AT&L -- technology and logistics -- all of whom are involved in acquisition.\nIt turns out that during her 10-year tenure, the secretary of the Air Force changed two or three times, with periods of acting. The assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition changed several times, with periods for acting vacancies. And as you know our entire department operates generally somewhere between 20 and 25 percent vacant in presidential appointees, Senate-confirmed, because of the nature of the ethics reviews, the FBI reviews, and the Senate confirmation process, which means we end up with about a quarter of the people who are supposed to be here operating the department not there at any given moment. The third key position was the military assistant under -- assistant -- or undersecretary for -- or under -- what was it called? Deputy. (Laughter.) Deputy assistant secretary for acquisition is the military side, and I'm told that there's some rules that apply there that -- from I think Goldwater-Nichols -- that that individual can't make major acquisition decisions.\nSo what you had with all these vacancies over a 10-year period, you had a -- the only continuity was that single person, who's now plead guilty and is going to go to jail. When you have that long period of time with that person the only continuity and no one above her and no one below her, over time I'm told what she did was acquire a great deal of authority and make a lot of decisions, and there was very little adult supervision above, below or on the side.\nNow is that how it happened? Well, first of all you have a person who's a criminal, who broke the law in there. And then the question is how could a criminal, over a sustained period -- (chuckles) -- succeed without being noticed, which is, I think, your question and certainly the question I asked myself, and it's worrisome. And I think that part of the -- I've given you part of the answer. You have too much turbulence on the military side, too much turbulence plus vacancies on the civilian side, and a person who has continuity -- the only one with continuity -- who is going to break the law. And what they were able -- what she was able to do over a period of time is acquire enough authority and enough -- apparently enough buffers around her that others didn't have transparency into what she was doing. I'm told that when Secretary Roche and Secretary -- Assistant Secretary Sambur came in, they looked at that situation, were uncomfortable with it, and began taking authorities away from her and trying to reestablish a different arrangement in that office, and that that was one of the reasons that apparently she began negotiating for her departure, because her authorities were being eroded.\nNow is that definitive? No. Is it an impression I have at this point? Yes. Have I stopped looking and worrying and thinking about it? You bet I haven't. It's a serious thing when you've got a war going on and you have someone in the department conducting -- engaging in criminal activity, which she confesses to, of that magnitude, that it's not caught. Obviously, there's something needs to be changed, and I think a lot has been changed. But we're going to have to make sure that doesn't happen elsewhere.\nThank you very much.\nQ And a follow-up on continuity, please?\nGEN. MYERS: Thank you.\nQ Will you be staying around for a second term -- speaking of continuity? Have you talked to the president yet about that?\nSEC. RUMSFELD: No! (I'll ?) have to do that (sometime ?). (Laughter.)\nQ Going to have Thanksgiving with the troops, Mr. Secretary? (No audible response.) ####\n(C) COPYRIGHT 2004, FEDERAL NEWS SERVICE, INC., 1000 VERMONT AVE. NW; 5TH FLOOR; WASHINGTON, DC - 20005, USA. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

It uses very high-temperature [[w:electrolysis|electrolysis]] to separate hydrogen from water, so that hydrogen may be used for [[w:energy|energy]] production.", "Electrolysis is one method by which laboratories and factories produce hydrogen. An electrical current is passed through water, breaking it down into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which are then collected above the water reservoir.", "Researchers in [[w:Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City, Utah]], at ''Ceramtech Incorporated'', in collaboration with workers at ''The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory'' report that when water is superheated to 800 degrees Celsius, far less electricity is required to produce the same volume of hydrogen. The researchers envision that future nuclear fission plants could be used both to heat the water as part of their cooling system, and generate the needed electricity.", "Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of such arrangements, however.  Jeremy Desterhoft, an independent consultant on nuclear energy safety, warns the \"elevated levels of radiation required to sufficiently lower the atomic separation point is beyond the current capabilities of any recent cooler.\"  He does not believe that economically viable cooling technology will be available for at least four to six more years.", "{archive}}\n{{publish}}"], "categories": ["Science and technology", "November 28, 2004", "United States", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Chemistry"], "sources": [{"language": "en", "maintext": "WASHINGTON - Researchers at a government nuclear laboratory and a ceramics company in South Salt Lake say they have found a way to produce pure hydrogen with far less energy than other methods, raising the possibility of using nuclear power to indirectly wean the transportation system from its dependence on oil.\nThe development would move the country closer to the Energy Department's goal of a ''hydrogen economy,'' in which hydrogen would be created through a variety of means, and would be consumed by devices called fuel cells, to make electricity to run cars.\nExperts cite three big obstacles to a hydrogen economy: manufacturing hydrogen cleanly and at low cost; finding a way to ship it and store it; and reducing the astronomical price of fuel cells.\n''This is a breakthrough in the first part,'' said J. Stephen Herring, a consulting engineer at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, which plans to announce the development today with Cerametec Inc. of South Salt Lake.\nThe developers also said the hydrogen could be used by oil companies to stretch oil supplies even without solving the fuel cell and transportation problems.\nHerring said the experimental work showed the ''highest-known production rate of hydrogen by high-temperature electrolysis.''\nBut the plan requires the building of a new kind of nuclear reactor, at a time when the United States is not even building conventional reactors. And the cost estimates are uncertain.\nThe heart of the plan is an improvement on the most convenient way to extract hydrogen, which is to run electric current through water, splitting the H2O molecule into hydrogen and oxygen, a process called electrolysis.\nIf the electricity comes from coal, which is the biggest source of power in this country, then the energy value of the ingredients - the amount of energy given off when the fuel is burned - is 3 1/2 to four times larger than the energy value of the product. Also, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions increase when the additional coal is burned.\nHydrogen can also be extracted by mixing steam with natural gas, and breaking apart both molecules, but the price of natural gas is rising rapidly.\nThe new method involves running electricity through water that has a high temperature. As the water molecule breaks up, a ceramic sieve separates the oxygen from the hydrogen. The resulting hydrogen has about half the energy value of the energy put into the process, the developers say. Such losses may be acceptable, or even desirable, because hydrogen for a nuclear reactor can be substituted for oil, which is imported and expensive, and because the basic fuel, uranium, is plentiful.\nThe idea is to build a reactor that would heat the cooling medium in the nuclear core, in this case helium gas, to about 1,000 degrees Celsius, or more than 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The existing generation of reactors, used exclusively for electricity generation, use water for cooling and heat it to only about 300 degrees Celsius.\nThe hot gas would be used two ways. It would spin a turbine to make electricity, which could be run through the water being separated. And it would heat that water, to 800 degrees Celsius.\nThe goal is to create a reactor that could produce about 300 megawatts of electricity for the grid, enough to run about 300,000 window air conditioners, or produce about 2.5 kilos of hydrogen per second. When burned, a kilo of hydrogen has about the same energy as a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline. But fuel cells, which work without burning, get about twice as much work out of each unit of fuel. In that case, the reactor might replace more than 400,000 gallons of gasoline per day.\nThere is only limited experience building high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, though, and no one in this country has ordered any kind of big reactor, even those of more conventional design, in 30 years, except for those whose construction was canceled before completion.\nAnd the United States has no infrastructure for shipping large volumes of hydrogen. Currently, most hydrogen is produced at the point where it is used, mostly in oil refineries. Hydrogen is used to draw the sulfur out of crude oil, and to break up hydrocarbon molecules that are too big for use in liquid fuel, and change the carbon-hydrogen ratio to one more favorable for vehicle fuel.\nHerring suggested another use, however: recovering usable fuel from the Athabasca Tar Sands in Alberta, Canada. The reserves there may hold the largest oil deposits in the world, but extracting them and converting them into a gasoline substitute requires copious amounts of steam and hydrogen, both products of the reactor.", "title": "Salt Lake Tribune Home Page", "url": "http://www.sltrib.com/ci_2475855", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041129183132/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_2475855"}]}

{"title": "USL v. BSDi settlement agreement unsealed", "text": ["{{publish}}\n{{byline|date{archive}}"], "categories": ["November 28, 2004", "Science and technology", "United States"], "sources": [{"language": "en", "maintext": "Finally, we have legally obtained the settlement agreement [PDF] between USL and The Regents of the University of California settling their 1990s lawsuits, thanks to Groklaw's dburns, who figured out that California has a Public Records Law, under which he made persistent application to obtain this document. Finally, after dotting all the i's and crossing all the required t's, he received the document from The Regents of the University of California's Office of the General Counsel, with a cover letter that reads in pertinent part: \"This is in further response to your request for legal filings, deposition transcripts, court orders and settlements in the California Superior Court case no. 717864-3. We have determined that the confidential 1994 settlement agreement between UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. and The Regents which was not filed with the court, may be disclosed to you under the Public Records Act.\" And so the bullying by secrecy is over.\nIt's a peace treaty between the parties, neither of whom actually agrees that the other's claims are necessarily true, but they agree as to what each will do going forward to lay down their arms. USL claimed ownership over certain files, as you can see in the opening words of the settlement: \"1. USL contends it is the owner of the intellectual property rights in portions of certain computer operating system software (the 'UNIX System').\" Contending and proving are two different things. The University agrees that portions of its software \"were developed independently by University personnel and others and portions of said releases were derived from versions of the UNIX System licensed to the University\" and USL acknowledges that it \"incorporated material derived from the BSD Releases in versions of the UNIX System\". The parties then go on to work out their differences. There are four categories the parties place various files into, categories they agreed to, not you and I, to settle the action, \"Restricted Files\" (Exhibit A), \"UNIX Derived Files\" (Exhibit B), which includes 23 files USL approved for release in BSD4Lite, and \"Unrestricted Files\" (Exhibit C). \"Restricted Files\" are files contained in Net2 which \"USL contends contain materials from the UNIX System and/or use or disclose methods and concepts in the UNIX System and whose further distribution is restricted pursuant to this Settlement Agreement.\" To put a finer point on it, these are files that *the University* agreed they wouldn't further distribute. They also agreed to \"take reasonable steps\" to \"encourage\" everyone with access to Net2 to switch to 4.4 BSD(Lite). In addition, the University agreed that USL could \"undertake an effort to advise persons of USL's contention that the Restricted Files may contain material that is proprietary to USL.\" \"Contention.\" \"May contain...\" The University isn't even signing off on USL's contentions. And I note what seems like a Get-Out-of-Jail-Free card, in section 3c: \"c. USL agrees that it shall take no action against any person who utilizes any methods and concepts in the Restricted Files which as of this date have become available to the general public by acts not attributable to the University, its employees or students. Nothing in this provision shall limit USL's rights against a third party arising out of a breach of any license agreement with USL or AT&T.\" Now we know why SCO keeps telling us the case is \"just a contract\" case, why it has a penchant for suing only those who are, or were, their licensees, and why it sued IBM instead of Red Hat. USL preserves its rights against licensees under the license agreements. I see no expanded rights against third parties who are not licensees, just the preexisting right to try to sue them, with the same likely outcome that USL experienced when it tried to sue the University and BSDi, using the same lame copyright claims that the judge back then found so unconvincing. The University agrees it won't stand in USL's way if they sue third parties: \"7. Further Participation in Litigation. The University agrees that it will not actively assist or support BSDI's defenses or counterclaims in the Federal Action or the efforts of any other party who asserts in any action the right to copy, use, or disclose to non-licensees of USL any of the material contained in the Restricted Files or the invalidity of USL's proprietary rights in the UNIX System. However, nothing in this provision shall prohibit the University from responding to any discovery permitted a third party under federal or state law or from defending any claim that may be asserted against the University or the Individual Regents.\" USL makes the same assertion about \"UNIX Derived Files\", that they contain materials USL contends is derived from or based on UNIX, but which the parties agree the University can freely distribute under the terms of the settlement, meaning with a copyright notice and list of \"restrictions on use and distribution\" as per clause 2e: \"e. Without waiving any of its proprietary rights therein, USL agrees that UNIX Derived Files listed in Exhibit B, or any material therein, may be freely distributed by the University and may be freely reproduced and redistributed by others without payment of any royalties or fees and without execution of any license agreement with USL and/or the University, provided such files or portions thereof include, in text form, a USL Copyright Notice and the same list of restrictions on use and redistribution of the software presently contained in the Net2 version of the file. Attached as Exhibit F is a copy of said notice which has been agreed upon by the parties.\" Notice the \"may be freely reproduced and redistributed by others\" part? I believe SCO tried to tell us they never gave Linux any such right to use, even with a copyright notice, but doesn't this clause seem to pull the rug out from that assertion? Here are some review links on SCO's position. In turn, USL, in 3(f), agreed to \"affix the University Copyright Notice and the University Acknowledgment\" on all the files listed in Exhibit C, the \"Unrestricted Files,\" all the rest of the files in Net2, which the University asserted were derived from BSD Releases \"which are contained in the UNIX System or are otherwise distributed by USL\". I wonder if they have? Remembering the SCOForum disastrous unveiling, I'm thinking maybe not. Perhaps some of you out there can tell us. USL agreed not to take any action based on the use or distribution \"by any person\" of the Unrestricted Files. Finally, the second Get-Out-of-Jail card is that everything in 4.4 BSD(Lite) \"may be publicly distributed to third parties free of any claim by USL of restrictions on its use or further distribution.\" All the rest is FUD. Surprised? What seems the most significant to me is that instead of filing this agreement with the court and getting the court to sign off on it, instead they agreed to file for a dismissal of the action and keep it just between the two of them. I see USL claiming it has certain rights, which may or may not be upheld if it ever went to a lawsuit, except with respect to the University, based on this settlement. Maybe they would be, maybe they wouldn't with respects to third parties. Feel free to correct me if you lawyers out there disagree, but that is how it reads to me. dburns did most of the transcription, for which I thank him. I'm sure we all thank him for all he did. I did Exhibit C, and it had to be done by hand because the original is fuzzy, so please do let me know of any errors or typos. In certain cases, I simply had to make an educated guess as to what a letter was. I know with your expertise, you'll catch any mistakes, and we'll be able to perfect the list. For anything that matters, go by the original, of course. We strive for accuracy, but I can't guarantee it. Also, for those directly affected by this information, seek an attorney's opinion on what it all means. I am not one, as you know. Our contribution is simply to make it available. *********************************** SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT This Settlement Agreement is entered into between UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. (\"USL\"), a Delaware corporation, and The Regents of the University of California (the \"University\"), a California corporation. Recitals 1. USL contends it is the owner of the intellectual property rights in portions of certain computer operating system software (the \"UNIX System\"). 2. USL and USL's predecessor in interest, the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. (\"AT&T\"), have licensed the University to use certain versions of UNIX\u00ae system software, prepare derivative works therefrom, and to distribute such works according to the terms of the parties' license agreements. 3. The university has developed operating system software which it has released to third parties (the \"BSD Releases\"). Portions of the BSD Releases were developed independently by University personnel and others and portions of said releases were derived from versions of the UNIX System licensed to the University. 1 4. Pursuant to license agreements with the University, USL has incorporated material derived from the BSD Releases in versions of the UNIX System. 5. In July of 1991, the University made a public distribution of certain operating system software known as the Second Networking Release (\"Net2\"). 6. USL has brought an action against the University, the individual members of the Board of Regents of the University (the \"Individual Regents\"), and Berkeley Software Design, Inc. (\"BSDI\") in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Civil No. 92-1667 (the \"Federal Action\") alleging inter alia that Net2 infringes USL's copyright in the UNIX System. 7. The University has brought an action in the Superior Court of the State of California, Alameda County, Case No. 717864-3 (the \"State Action\"), alleging that USL has failed to comply with certain provisions of its license agreements with the University in connection with USL's distribution of UNIX System software and seeking a declaratory judgment that the University's distribution of Net2 did not violate USL's rights. 8. The University wishes to issue another BSD Release (\"4.4 BSD(Lite)\") that may be publicly distributed to third 2 parties free of any claim by USL of restrictions on its use or further distribution. 9. The parties wish to settle and compromise all of USL's claims against the University and the Individual Regents relating to distribution of Net2 and all of the University's claims against USL relating to the UNIX System and the BSD Releases in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. Definitions The following definitions apply to terms used in this Settlement Agreement: 1. Restricted Files are files contained in Net2 which USL contends contain materials from the UNIX System and/or use or disclose methods and concepts contained in the UNIX System and whose further distribution is restricted pursuant to this Settlement Agreement. A list of the Restricted Files is attached as Exhibit A. 2. UNIX Derived Files are files contained in Net2 or 4.4 BSD(Lite) which contain material USL contends is derived from or based upon the UNIX System, but which USL has agreed may be freely distributed subject to the terms of this Settlement 3 Agreement. The UNIX Derived Files include 23 files from 4.4 BSD(Lite) which, prior to the execution of this Settlement Agreement, USL has reviewed and approved for inclusion in the 4.4 BSD(Lite) release. A list of the UNIX Derived Files is attached as Exhibit B. 3. Unrestricted BSD Files are: all files which are contained in Net2 other than the Restricted Files and the UNIX Derived Files. 4. BSD Derived Materials are computer files or documents which the University contends are derived from the BSD Releases which are contained in the UNIX System or are otherwise distributed by USL. A list of the BSD Derived Materials is attached as Exhibit C. 5. Joint Press Release is the document attached as Exhibit D. 6. USL Copyright Notice is a notice in the following form: \u00a9 UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. All or some portions of this file are derived from material licensed to the University of California by American Telephone and Telegraph Co. or UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. and are reproduced herein with the permission of UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. 4 7. University Copyright Notice is a notice in the following form: Copyright \u00a9 1982, 1986, 1988\nThe Regents of the University of California\nAll Rights Reserved. 8. University Acknowledgment is the following statement: Portions of this document are derived from software developed by the University of California, Berkeley, and its contributors. Terms of Settlement Agreement 1. Incorporation of Sections. The \"Definitions\" set forth above are incorporated into and are made a part of this section entitled \"Terms of Settlement Agreement.\" 2. Exchange of Materials for Inspection. a. At or prior to the execution of this Settlement Agreement, the University shall deliver to USL a true and authentic copy, in text form, of each of the files listed on Exhibits A and B of this Settlement Agreement. 5 b. Prior to the execution of this Settlement Agreement, USL shall have delivered to the University, subject to restrictions on use and disclosure, a true and authentic copy of System V, Release 4.0 of the UNIX System. The University shall return such copy upon or prior to execution of this Settlement Agreement. 3. Distribution and Use of Software. a. The University agrees that it shall not make any further distributions of the Restricted Files. The University also agrees to take reasonable steps to encourage all persons who have obtained access to Net2 to substitute 4.4 BSD(Lite). Such encouragement shall include issuing the Joint Press Release attached as Exhibit D, notifying all University Net2 licensees of the availability of 4.4 BSD(Lite) and providing with said notification a copy of the Joint Press Release, posting the Joint Press Release and a notice on the Internet network about the availability of 4.4 BSD(Lite), and making known 4.4 BSD(Lite)'s availability when inquiries are made; in all such instances, the University shall recommend the substitution of 4.4 BSD(Lite) for Net2. The University agrees to mail a copy of the Joint Press Release to its Net2 licensees within thirty (30) days of the execution of this Settlement Agreement. 6 b. The University agrees that USL may undertake an effort to advise persons of USL's contention that the Restricted Files may contain material which is proprietary to USL and which may not be copied, distributed, used, or further disclosed without express written permission of USL and that they have a three (3) month grace period within which to cease internal use of the Restricted Files by converting to 4.4 BSD(Lite) or otherwise. USL agrees that it shall take no action based upon the use of such files during the grace period against any person who ceases to make further distribution or disclosure of any material contained in the Restricted Files, including any methods and concepts contained therein, upon receiving such notice and who ceases internal use of the Restricted Files within the three month grace period. c. USL agrees that it shall take no action against any person who utilizes any methods and concepts in the Restricted Files which as of this date have become available to the general public by acts not attributable to the University, its employees or students. Nothing in this provision shall limit USL's rights against a third party arising out of a breach of any license agreement with USL or AT&T. d. The University agrees that to the extent 4.4 BSD(Lite) contains any material contained in the UNIX Derived Files, the files in which such matter is contained will include, 7 in text form, the USL Copyright Notice and list of restrictions on use and distribution of the software required by section 2.e of this Settlement Agreement. e. Without waiving any of its proprietary rights therein, USL agrees that UNIX Derived Files listed in Exhibit B, or any material therein, may be freely distributed by the University and may be freely reproduced and redistributed by others without payment of any royalties or fees and without execution of any license agreement with USL and/or the University, provided such files or portions thereof include, in text form, a USL Copyright Notice and the same list of restrictions on use and redistribution of the software presently contained in the Net2 version of the file. Attached as Exhibit F is a copy of said notice which has been agreed upon by the parties. f. USL agrees that it shall affix the University Copyright Notice and the University Acknowledgment to the files listed in Exhibit C in the following manner: (i) USL shall prepare a notice advising all licensees of UNIXWARE 2.0 that all or part of the files listed in Exhibit C are derived from materials licensed to UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. by the University of California and should be 8 deemed to contain the University Copyright Notice and the University Acknowledgment (the \"Notice\"). (ii) A printed copy of the Notice shall be distributed with all copies of UNIXWARE 2.0 distributed prior to January 31, 1995. (iii) All copies of UNIXWARE 2.0 distributed prior to April 30, 1994 shall contain at least one \"readme\" file, in the root directory, setting forth the text of the Notice. (iv) All copies of UNIXWARE 2.0 distributed after April 30, 1994 shall contain a \"readme\" file setting forth the text of the Notice in each directory containing any of the files set forth in Exhibit C, other than the .mk files, that does not contain a copy of the University Copyright Notice and the University Acknowledgment. (v) In any future release of the UNIX System issued following the issuance of UNIXWARE 2.0, USL shall include the University Copyright Notice and the University Acknowledgment in all of the files listed in Exhibit C, other than the .mk files (the \"Files\"). In all events, USL shall include the 9 University Copyright Notice and the University Acknowledgment in all such Files in any copies of UNIXWARE 2.0 distributed after January 31, 1995. If any such File contains a copyright notice reflecting publication by the University at some date earlier than the dates appearing in the University Copyright Notice, USL shall not delete the reference to such earlier date(s) of publication, but shall include those dates in addition to the later dates reflected in the University Copyright Notice. g. In any future release of the UNIX System issued following the issuance of UNIXWARE 2.0, USL shall include the University Acknowledgment in all .mk files listed on Exhibit C. In all events, USL shall include in any copies of UNIXWARE 2.0 distributed after January 31, 1995 the University Acknowledgment in all such .mk files. h. USL agrees that it shall affix the University Copyright Notice on and include the University Acknowledgment in any future editions of the publications listed in Exhibit E and any new publications, documentation, instructions, books, pamphlets, or electronic or written communication of any kind including those for UNIXWARE 2.0, which include the BSD Derived Materials (the \"New Publications\"). If any such New Publications 10 have already been printed for UNIXWARE 2.0 without the University Copyright Notice and without the University Acknowledgment, USL shall reprint or amend them in such a way as to include said Notice and Acknowledgment. i. USL agrees that it shall take no action based on the use or distribution by any person of material contained in the Unrestricted Files. 4. Joint Press Release. The parties agree to the issuance of the Joint Press Release within fifteen (15) days of the execution of this Settlement Agreement and to issue or authorize no statements which are inconsistent therewith. 5. Stipulations. Upon execution of this Settlement Agreement, the parties shall instruct their respective attorneys to enter into a stipulation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, consenting to the vacatur of the orders and decisions entered in the Federal Action on March 3 and 30, 1993 denying USL's motion for a preliminary injunction and to the dismissal of the Federal Action, with prejudice and without costs to any party. 6. State Action Dismissal. Within fifteen (15) days following execution of this Settlement Agreement, the University shall file a dismissal of the State Action, with prejudice. 11 7. Further Participation in Litigation. The University agrees that it will not actively assist or support BSDI's defenses or counterclaims in the Federal Action or the efforts of any other party who asserts in any action the right to copy, use, or disclose to non-licensees of USL any of the material contained in the Restricted Files or the invalidity of USL's proprietary rights in the UNIX System. However, nothing in this provision shall prohibit the University from responding to any discovery permitted a third party under federal or state law or from defending any claim that may be asserted against the University or the Individual Regents. 8. Releases. a. USL hereby releases the University and the Individual Regents, their agents, servants, employees, predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and any other persons acting on their behalf, from any and all claims, whether known or unknown, arising out of or relating to the University's development and distribution of Net2 and any other matter that was the subject of any of the claims asserted by USL in the Federal Action. b. The University hereby releases USL, its agents, servants, employees, predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and any other persons acting on their 12 behalf from any and all claims, whether known or unknown, arising out of or relating to USL's distribution of the UNIX System or any other products, documents or materials (including specifically any claim that USL failed to provide adequate recognition or proper notice in such products, documents or materials), or any other matter which was the subject of any of the claims asserted by the University in the State Action. c. USL and the University waive the provisions of California Civil Code section 1542, which provides as follows: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\" 9. The University's Representations and Warranties. a. The University hereby represents and warrants that the execution, delivery, and performance of this Settlement Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary action, and that the individual who executes this Settlement Agreement on the University's behalf is duly authorized to do so. b. The University hereby represents and warrants that the files delivered to USL pursuant to Section 2(a) of this 13 Settlement Agreement are true and authentic copies of such files as included in Net2 or 4.4 BSD(Lite). c. The University hereby represents and warrants that, to the best of its knowledge, information, and belief, with the exception of the UNIX-Derived files, 4.4 BSD(Lite) does not contain any material or methods and concepts (other than methods or concepts that have become available to the general public by acts not attributable to the University, its employees or students) contained in (i) the Restricted Files or (ii) any other UNIX System Software which is proprietary to USL. The University further represents and warrants that, to the best of its knowledge, information, and belief, to the extent 4.4 BSD(Lite) contains material distributed with the UNIX System which is not proprietary to USL, the University has been authorized to include such material in 4.4 BSD(Lite) by the owner of the rights thereto, in the event the University learns that 4.4 BSD(Lite) contains any materials which would violate any of the terms of this paragraph, the University shall so notify USL, promptly remove such material from future distributions of 4.4 BSD(Lite), and take appropriate action to advise persons who have received copies of 4.4 BSD(Lite) to remove such materials from their copies. 14 10. USL's Representations and Warranties. a. USL hereby represents and warrants that the execution, delivery, and performance of this Settlement Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary action, and that the individual who executes this Settlement Agreement on USL's behalf is duly authorized to do so. b. USL hereby represents and warrants that the software delivered to the University pursuant to Section 2(b) of this Settlement Agreement is a true and authentic copy of System V, Release 4.0 of the UNIX System. 11. Counterparts. This Settlement Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same Settlement Agreement. 12. Fees and Costs. Each party to this Settlement Agreement shall pay its own costs and attorney's fees. 13. Non-Admission.This Settlement Agreement shall not constitute or be construed as an admission of liability by one party to the other or to any third party. 15 14. Successors and Assigns. The burdens and benefits of this Settlement Agreement shall be binding upon the respective successors and assigns of USL and the University. 15. Confidentiality. Subject to the parties' agreement to issue the Joint Press Release, the parties agree to keep the contents of this Settlement Agreement confidential. The parties shall not provide a copy of this Settlement Agreement to anyone other than to those select employees of the parties and, in the case of USL, its parent, Novell Corporation, which have a legitimate need for access to this Settlement Agreement. This provision shall not preclude either party from disclosing the contents of this Settlement Agreement as necessary to inform others of the settlement, the restrictions on further use and distribution of Net2, and the parties' agreement regarding the use of 4.4 BSD(Lite). This provision shall not preclude the University from producing a copy of this Settlement Agreement if required to do so by federal or state law nor shall it preclude the parties from generally describing this Settlement Agreement in terms consistent with the Joint Press Release. 16. Effect on UNIX Software License Agreements. This Settlement Agreement shall not relieve either party of its respective rights and obligations pursuant to the existing UNIX software license agreements between the University and AT&T or USL, nor shall it alter any of the terms of such agreements. 16 17. Amendments. This Settlement Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument executed by all the parties hereto. 18. Entire Agreement. This Settlement Agreement, including the Exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the allegations and issues raised in the Federal Action and the State Action and supersedes any and all prior agreements of the parties, oral and written, with respect to the allegations and issues raised in said Actions.

{"title": "Lycos launches screensaver to increase spammers' bills", "text": ["{{byline|date[w:Spamming|Spamming]], the mass sending of unsolicited emails, is lucrative in part because each email can be sent for nearly insignificant costs. With such low costs, a commercial spammer needs only to have a very small number of recipients buy their product to make a profit. The goal of many anti-spam proposals has been to increase the cost of spammers sending messages. Lycos' approach is to make it more expensive to maintain servers that send spam.", "Volunteers may download the screensaver from the [http://makelovenotspam.com/intl/index.html Lycos website for it]. The program would run on a user's computer in the background and request about three [[w:Megabyte|megabytes]] (3MBs) of data every day. The screensaver shows which spam server is being targeted by the user, where the server is located, and how many others are attacking it at that moment.

This is a process that is considered to be illegal, and has been used in the past to bring down some high-profile sites.\nThe screensaver--titled \"Make Love, Not Spam\"--is available for Windows and Mac OS, and works similar to the SETI@home project. This makes use of the spare computing power of millions of computers to process large amounts of data.\nWhen the screensaver comes on, your computer is instructed to send a request to view a spam source site from a database. These sites are kept current from various sources and verified to be spam advertising sites, claims Lycos. You never actually see the site itself.\nThere is a set limit of data that your computer can request, around 3Mb a day. If a lot of computers start to run the screensaver that could add up to enough data flooding the spam servers to slow them considerably, or even bring them down. The screensaver displays the real-time stats of which servers are getting hit, and how their performance is being affected.\nSince most servers of this type only pay for bandwidth, and do not run advertising, the hope is that the costs will exceed the profits--and the spammers will give up.\nSo, technically, Lycos is offering users the chance to convert their computers into taking part in a widespread DDoS effort. There is a disclaimer before installing the screensaver that it is done at the user's own risk.\nOn the other hand, spammers do encourage people to click on links and visit their sites in the hope that people will buy something. So, is Lycos just automatically helping users take them up on that invitation?\nMy view--and I detest spammers and their methods--is that this is not the way to fight them. There would be uproar if a company encouraged a DDoS against Microsoft, eBay or Yahoo.\nSo what do you think? Please send any views on this subject to letters@siliconvalleynorth.com.\nUpdate Dec. 1\nThe site has been taken down now, and visitors just see the message below:\n\"Yes, attacking spammers is wrong, you know this, you shouldn't be doing it. Your IP address and request have been logged and will be reported to your ISP for further action. Also, note: This machine is not hacked, this page is returned for EVERY request. Thanks for noticing though.\"\nA possible explanation follows from an independent observer...\nISPs see this \"MLNS\" program as a violation of their usage policies. The program essentially launches a denial of service attack against a number of sites classified as \"spammers.\"\nNeedless to say, a denial of service attack represents an unwanted, if not illegal, action and ISPs try to block access to the MLNS controller in the same way they regularly block access to other DDoS controlling hosts.\nI did run the tool for a while to investigate its traffic. The system does not appear to target mail servers sending spam, but instead it targets the sites advertised by spam.\nThe program essentially organizes its participants into a vigilante mob, attacking whatever Web site is apparently advertised by spam.\nHowever, it is impossible to tell how many innocent bystanders are hit by the same packets (for example, other customers of the ISP that may be sharing bandwidth or hardware with the spammer).\nJohannes Ullrich\nCTO\nSANS Internet Storm Centre\nFeedback\nI'm happy to see that Lycos is the first company ever to figure out how to stop the spam. Or are they? Since the days of the Green Card Spammers and Cyberpromo, attacks have been a tool available to a wide variety of network operators yet we have \"failed\" to utilize them.\nIt must be that network operators don't condone abuse and would never engage in something designed to increase traffic on a network owned by someone else and with potential to cause a large amount of collateral damage.\nAnd since spammers temporarily take up positions on remote computers that are usually owned by a botnet, we'll see little to no impact--and probably see consumers left holding the bag for the excess bandwidth utilization that the now-gone spammer is responsible for.\nI suspect that Lycos' initiative won't pass the smell test with many operators and we'll see this idea go by the wayside rather rapidly.\nMartin Hannigan\nIn an ideal world, the idea is a good thing, because in theory it tries to break the business model of spammers (makes it expensive for them to send out spam--since they have to deploy more servers and bandwidth to deal with the barrage of DoS attacks from the innocent--to the point where the marginal cost of sending spam is higher than the marginal revenue of spam).\nTaxing spammers is not a new concept, and this one more way to do so.\nHowever, in a practical world, there could be some unintended consequences (a.k.a gotchas).\nHere are two of them:\n-- TAXING THE WRONG RESOURCES: First is the issue of inadvertently taxing not just the spammers' resources (as was intended) but also the person/organization being spammed (this is unintended of course). Computing resources, desktop, server and network will be consumed. Even though they will try to load balance it, there is still a hit on these resources. Naturally, there is a cost-benefit argument here: if less resources are consumed than would have been consumed by the spammer, then organizations should be ok. But I question the ability to achieve this equilibrium.\n-- BLACKLISTS ARE NOT PERFECT: Second is the issue of blacklists. At the core of the screensaver is a blacklist or aggregated set of blacklists. Blacklists work great as long as the bad people are on it, and the good people stay off it. This is a big assumption. There will undoubtedly be IP addresses or domains that mistakenly make it to these blacklists (perhaps valid e-mailers, or someone who was unfortunate enough to be infected with a Trojan spam that in turn spams others--a so-called distributed spam attack). In the event that the wrong IP/domain ends up on the blacklists that Lycos uses, then victimized organization will get hit with what is essentially a DoS attack. This will have adverse consequences on that organization's IT resources.\nRami Habal\nSenior Product Manager\nProofpoint Inc.", "title": "Silicon Valley NORTH", "url": "http://www.siliconvalleynorth.com/home/newsGeyWBmzllk20041129.html", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041204213700/http://www.siliconvalleynorth.com/home/newsGeyWBmzllk20041129.html"}, {"language": "no", "maintext": "Make Love, not Spam!\np2pnet.net News:- Lycos Europe is now has a screen saver with a difference.\nCalled Make Love, not Spam, it's a program for Windows or MacOS that, \"constantly visits websites for which spam has been sent,\" says Heise Online, quoting Lycos as saying, \"The more users download and use the screen saver, the lower the performance of the sites sending out the spam, and the greater the costs for the operators.\"\nIt's apparently counting on a large number of its European users - 20 million, it claims - to download the screen saver.

Auch Cap hob hervor, dass jene an vorderster Front in viele Konflikte eingebunden seien. Darabos r\u00e4umte zwar ein, dass man sich mehr Zustimmung gew\u00fcnscht h\u00e4tte. Aber man werde \"den Kurs fortsetzen, die SP\u00d6 ins Zentrum der sozialen Frage zu stellen\", betont Darabos. Broukal: \"Wenig erfreulich, aber keine Katastrophe\" Wissenschaftssprecher Josef Broukal meint, das Ergebnis f\u00fcr Gusenbauer sei \"wenig erfreulich, aber auch keine Katastrophe\". Broukal sieht darin auch eine Folge von \"unfairer Behandlung durch den politischen Gegner, unterst\u00fctzt durch das, was in vielen Medien in Kommentaren zu lesen ist\". Haider: Keine Kritik Ober\u00f6sterreichs Landes-SP\u00d6-Chef Erich Haider lobte die Rede Gusenbauers und hob hervor, dass es in der Diskussion keine Kritik am Parteichef gegeben habe. Allerdings h\u00e4tte er sich auch ein besseres Ergebnis gew\u00fcnscht. \u00c4hnlich \u00e4u\u00dferte sich die K\u00e4rntner Landesr\u00e4tin Gabriele Schaunig. Sie h\u00e4tte sich erhofft, dass die SP\u00d6 am K\u00e4rntner Beispiel lernt, \"offenbar ist das doch nicht so\", meinte Schaunig. Gusenbauer selbst zeigt sich nicht entt\u00e4uscht Gusenbauer selbst sieht mit seiner Wiederwahl als SP\u00d6-Parteichef auch klar gestellt, dass er die SP\u00d6 als Spitzenkandidat in die n\u00e4chste Nationalratswahl f\u00fchren wird. \"Es ist mit dem heutigen Tag klar gestellt: Der Spitzenkandidat f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chste Wahl wird Alfred Gusenbauer hei\u00dfen\", erkl\u00e4rte er w\u00f6rtlich in der \"ZiB 2\" Montagabend. Nicht abbringen lie\u00df sich Gusenbauer von der Haltung, dass die von ihm erreichten 88,93 Prozent doch ein \"au\u00dferordentlich gro\u00dfer Vertrauensbeweis\" seien. Eine Abstimmung \u00fcber die Position des Spitzenkandidaten gab es beim SP\u00d6-Parteitag nicht. Aber der Wiener B\u00fcrgermeister Michael H\u00e4upl habe \"klar gesagt, dass die Abstimmung \u00fcber den Parteivorsitzenden auch die Abstimmung \u00fcber den Kanzlerkandidaten ist. Es gibt \u00fcberhaupt keinen Zweifel, dass ich als Spitzenkandidat die SP\u00d6 in die n\u00e4chste Wahl f\u00fchren werde\", sagte Gusenbauer. Was sein Abstimmungsergebnis - das nach Fred Sinowatz 1987 schlechteste in der SP\u00d6 - betrifft, verwies Gusenbauer darauf, dass selbst amtierende Bundeskanzler manchmal in der Vorsitzendenk\u00fcr nur auf 90 Prozent gekommen seien. Und in anderen Parteien gebe es Ergebnisse von 79 Prozent (FP\u00d6-Chefin Ursula Haubner im Juli d.J., Anm.) Die zehn Prozent der Delegierten, die gegen ihn gestimmt haben, will Gusenbauer in den n\u00e4chsten beiden Jahren durch seine Arbeit \u00fcberzeugen. Keinen Grund sieht er, ihren Motiven nachzugehen. \"Jetzt auf die Suche zu gehen, wo sind die so genannten Dissidenten, ist nicht mein Demokratieverst\u00e4ndnis.\" In einer demokratischen Wahl 90 Prozent zu erreichen, sei ein \"stolzes Ergebnis\", meinte Gusenbauer. Es w\u00e4re \"nicht normal\", in einer Demokratie 100 Prozent Zustimmung zu bekommen. \"Wenn man Demokrat ist, freut man sich \u00fcber eine Mehrheit.\" Als einziger Kandidat unter 90 Prozent Gusenbauer blieb als einziger des 70-k\u00f6pfigen Vorstandes unter der 90-Prozent-Marke. F\u00fcr seine Wiederwahl als Bundesparteivorsitzender ist nun die anschlie\u00dfende Wahl des Parteipr\u00e4sidiums ausschlaggebend. Daf\u00fcr wurde er vom Vorstand als einziger Kandidat nominiert. Vor zwei Jahren hatte er daf\u00fcr 99,6 Prozent erreicht. Worst of Das zweitschlechteste Ergebnis im Vorstand hat der K\u00e4rntner Landesparteivorsitzende Peter Ambrozy mit 92,91 Prozent erzielt, das drittschlechteste der gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrende Klubobmann Josef Cap mit 94,43 Prozent. Best\u00e4tigt Als Bundesgesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer wiedergew\u00e4hlt wurden vom Vorstand Doris Bures und Norbert Darabos. Christoph Matznetter wurde als Kassier best\u00e4tigt. Gusenbauer: \"Eindrucksvoller Vertrauensbeweis\" Trotz seines eher entt\u00e4uschenden Abschneidens am SP\u00d6-Parteitag am Montag in Wien wertete Gusenbauer das Votum der Delegierten (88,9 Prozent) als \"eindrucksvollen Vertrauensbeweis\". Folgerichtig nahm er die Wahl ebenso wie die anderen Mitglieder des Pr\u00e4sidiums an. Gleichsam als Trost f\u00fcr das entt\u00e4uschende Abschneiden bei der Vorsitzenden-Wahl wurde Gusenbauer von den Delegierten mit lang anhaltendem rhythmischen Applaus und lauten \"Freundschaft\"-Rufen bedacht. Wiens B\u00fcrgermeister Michael H\u00e4upl, der in den vergangenen Tagen kr\u00e4ftig f\u00fcr Gusenbauer die Werbetrommel ger\u00fchrt hatte, versprach ihm im Schlusswort nochmals Unterst\u00fctzung: \"Du sollst wissen, dass Du Dich auf uns verlassen kannst.\" Schw\u00e4chstes Ergebnis seit Sinowatz Die 88,9 Prozent der Delegiertenstimmen bedeuten das schw\u00e4chste Ergebnis f\u00fcr einen sozialdemokratischen Vorsitzenden seit vielen Jahren. Konkret war es Fred Sinowatz, der im Herbst 1987 mit 88 Prozent als letzter eine niedrigere Zustimmung erhielt. Er trat dann - jedoch aus anderen Gr\u00fcnden - wenige Monate sp\u00e4ter zur\u00fcck. Besonders ungew\u00f6hnlich ist das Gusenbauer-Ergebnis aber auch nicht. So konnte Franz Vranitzky bei seiner letzten Wahl 1995 auch nur noch 90,5 Prozent erlangen, nachdem er sich zuvor \u00fcber Ergebnisse bis hin zu 98,5 Prozent (1991) erfreuen konnte. Viktor Klima stand nur einmal zur Wahl, n\u00e4mlich 1997 und da kam er blo\u00df auf 90,2 Prozent.

The report had been originally placed on the DSB's website in early November.\n'The current Board is authorized to consist of thirty-two members plus seven ex officio members': the chairmen of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Policy, Ballistic Missile Defense Advisory Committee, and Defense Intelligence Agency Science and Technology Advisory Committee.

Soldiers can only do so much. And the last mile in every war is about claiming the political fruits.

President Bush is expected to officially nominate Kerik on Friday.\nBush continued to move quickly Thursday to fill his new Cabinet, selecting two-term Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns to head the Department of Agriculture. Johanns, who will replace Ann Veneman, is the son of a dairy farmer and has championed ethanol and other alternative energy sources.\nJohanns and Kerik brought to seven the number of new Cabinet nominees Bush has chosen for his second presidential term, and more are expected.\nPreviously, Bush announced new choices for the departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Justice and State.\nIn another development, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Danforth submitted his resignation after less than six months on the job. There was no immediate word on a replacement.\nA spokesman for Danforth said he wanted to spend more time with his wife, Sally, and retire to his native St. Louis. Danforth, who made Sudan's humanitarian crisis a priority and had been mentioned as a possible secretary of state, never developed a solid relationship with Bush, another senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nKerik, a onetime beat cop and narcotics detective with a black belt, has risen rapidly through the ranks. He hit the political trail this fall stumping for Bush and delivering a primetime speech at the Republican Convention, leading some to speculate that the Giuliani protege might have his eye on elected office himself.\nMost recently, Kerik, 49, traded in New York for Iraq, leading the effort to build up the Iraqi police force. \"Baghdad Bernie,\" as he was dubbed in some of New York tabloids, won praise from Bush.\n\"Because of his leadership, his knowledge and his experience, he was able to stand up a police force in Baghdad in a very quick period of time,\" Bush said in an appearance with Kerik on the South Lawn in early October 2003.\nBut some officials grumble privately that Kerik left before the job was finished and seemed more interested in the TV lights than the hard work of training and recruiting an Iraqi police force.\nKerik will inherit a sprawling two-year-old department of 180,000 federal employees that has had its share of growing pains from incompatible computers, hiring freezes, low morale, turf battles with the Department of Justice and a color-coded terror alert level that's become fodder for late-night comedians.\nA childhood troublemaker who dropped out of school, Kerik found his path after serving in the U.S. Army. He got his first taste of antiterrorism work as a private security worker in Saudi Arabia. He joined the New York Police Department in 1986 and soon took over the city's department of corrections.\nHe was named police commissioner in 2000 with the department still reeling from racially charged scandals involving Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant assaulted in a station house with a broomstick, and Amadou Diallo, the West African immigrant who was shot 41 times by police who mistakenly believed he was reaching for a gun.\nBut it was Kerik's steady leadership through the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and their aftermath that earned him a national reputation.\nKerik penned a best-selling autobiography, \"The Lost Son,\" about his blue-collar roots, his work in law enforcement and his mother, who had abandoned him as a young boy.\nKerik is a senior vice president at Giuliani Partners, the New York-based consulting firm that the former mayor set up with a number of top aides after leaving office.\nHe's been a staunch supporter of Bush and the war in Iraq.\n\"It's better to fight terrorists in Iraq than in New York or Washington,\" he said recently.\n---\n(Knight Ridder Newspapers correspondents Warren P.

The penalties cap a yearlong Air Force probe into allegations that Boeing, the nation's No. 2 defense contractor after Lockheed Martin, used thousands of pages of stolen Lockheed documents in 1998 to beat its rival for contracts to build a military satellite-launch rocket. Boeing, which had won 14 military contracts to build the Delta IV satellite rocket system, must hand over seven of the contracts, worth about $700 million, to Lockheed, the Air Force said. Both companies now have 14 rocket contracts each. The Air Force suspended indefinitely three Boeing units: Boeing Launch Systems, Boeing Launch Services and the Delta rocket program office. Also suspended by the Air Force were three former Boeing employees allegedly involved in the scandal: William Erskine, Kenneth Branch and Larry Satchell. All worked on Boeing's rocket contracts. Last month, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted Branch and Erskine for misusing trade secrets during the 1998 bidding for the rocket contracts. Boeing fired the two in 1999. Branch, a former Lockheed engineer, was recruited in 1996 by Boeing engineer Erskine to bring proprietary Lockheed documents to Boeing in exchange for a high-salary job, according to the Justice Department. All of the suspensions will be lifted when Boeing shows it has corrected the problems that led to the alleged use of Lockheed's documents, according to Air Force Maj. Angela Billings. In a statement, Air Force Undersecretary Peter Teets said: \"We do not tolerate breaches of procurement integrity, and we hold industry accountable for the actions of their employees.\" Boeing CEO Phil Condit apologized Thursday, saying in a statement that \"we are extremely disappointed by the circumstances\" and \"we understand the U.S. Air Force's position that unethical behavior will not be tolerated.\" He said Boeing will conduct a work \"stand-down\" on July 30 of all 78,000 employees in its Integrated Defense Systems business unit to discuss the suspension and receive ethics training. \"We want to ensure that Boeing will never again have to face such criticism,\" Condit said. Air Force officials said Thursday they will award Lockheed three contracts, valued at $250 million, for new rockets to be launched at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

In their paper, Peter Stott of the UK Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, and colleagues say they \"estimate that it is very likely that human influence has at least doubled the risk\" of extreme weather events, such as the European heat wave. While it is impossible to attribute a single meteorological event, such as a heat wave or a flood, to changes in the atmosphere, it is possible, using available computer models, to estimate whether human activities increase the risk of such events taking place. Stott and colleagues did just that. They used a computer model to compare the likelihood of the 2003 heat wave taking place with and without human activities, which in the model included greenhouse gas emissions. The researchers conclude that human activities at least doubled the chance of the heat wave taking place, and say they are 90 per cent sure this statement is accurate. Previously, other scientists had made similar but unquantified estimates. In a SciDev.Net editorial earlier this year, Saleemul Huq, director of the Climate Change Programme at the International Institute for Environment and Development, wrote, \"It may be impossible to attribute [the 2004 floods in Bangladesh] to climate change\". \"But what can be said with certainty is that such events will occur with increasing frequency in the future, due to changes in the global climate system caused by greenhouse gas emissions attributable to human activities.\" Scientists are a long way from being able to determine exactly how far human activities were responsible for increasing the risk of severe floods in Bangladesh in 2004. However, says Stott, in theory the same methods that he and his colleagues used in their study could be applied to any weather event, anywhere in the world. PRECIS, a climate model based on the Hadley Centre's one, but able to be run on a personal computer, is just one of tools already being used in countries including Bhutan, Brazil and India to gain a better understanding of regional climate systems. Eventually, such information could lead to risk studies of regional weather events, like the one done by Stott and his colleagues. In accompanying article in Nature, Myles Allen, who supervised Stott's study, and UK lawyer Richard Lord write about the legal implications of the team's findings. \"Although these ideas may seem far-fetched now,\" they write, \"we could one day see Californian farmers suing member states of the European Union for authorising emissions that threatened the security of their water supplies.\" Stott agrees that following the same reasoning, farmers in Egypt might also one day sue European states for increasing the salinity of the water they use to water their crops. In fact, a group of environmental lawyers is already urging UNESCO to investigate the effects of climate change on three World Heritage Sites: the Belize Barrier Reef, and two national parks, one in the Andean and the other in the Himalayan mountain ranges. Pro Public, the environmental group leading the Himalayan campaign points out that in Nepal, it is not only the park that is endangered, but also the communities living beneath the swelling glacier lakes (see Melting glaciers threaten communities in South Asia). \"The Nepalese are not responsible for what's happening there,\" said Prakash Sharma, executive director of Pro Public in an interview with BBC Online. \"We might be a little bit responsible but I think [it is] the global phenomenon of climate change.\" Link to paper in Nature by Stott et al Link to article by Allen and Lord in Nature\nLink to BBC Online news story References: Nature 432, 551 (2004) / Nature 432, 610 (2004)\nRelated SciDev.Net articles:\nThreat of devastating floods 'will double' by 2050\nHaiti's lessons for managing the global environment\nBangladesh floods: rich nations 'must share the blame'\nRelated links:\nPRECIS\nHadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research\nPhoto Credit: NASA NASA\nDossiers:\nClimate Change", "title": "SciDev.Net", "url": "http://www.scidev.net/news/index.cfm?fuseaction=readnews&itemid=1784&language=1", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041204214617/http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=1784&language=1"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "an incomplete understanding of the climate system,\nan imperfect ability to transform our knowledge into accurate mathematical equations,\nthe limited power of computers,\nthe models' inability to reproduce important atmospheric phenomena, and\ninaccurate representations of the complex natural interconnections.\nThese weaknesses combine to make GCM-based predictions too uncertain to be used as the bases for public policy responses related to future climate changes.\nThe Limits of Human Knowledge.\nThe world's best scientists have only an incomplete understanding of how the various atmospheric, land surface, oceanic and ice components interact. Even if their understanding of the climate system were perfect, scientists would still face challenges. Consider that while scientists do have a general idea of the complex interrelationships of the atmosphere and the oceans, expressing this knowledge mathematically is very difficult.\nThe Limits of Computing Power.\nGCMs are limited in important ways. Global climate is produced through a variety of processes and interactions that operate on a wide range of scales, including molecular, regional, continental and global. Changes in climate occur from physical interactions that take place on any or all of these scales. The changes, and the resulting weather patterns, can occur nearly instantaneously or they can take decades or millenia to develop. Unfortunately, the computers and programs that run the GCMs are limited to gross representations of the geographic, geologic and atmospheric details that they use to run climate simulations. Thus, many small-scale features, such as a temporary but significant shift in the prevailing winds or unusually dry surface conditions due to increased evaporation from forest fires and high winds cannot be represented, even though they may significantly impact the local, regional, or even global climate.\nIndeed, GCMs can at best represent only a thumbnail sketch of the real world, with spatial resolutions no finer than regional areas a thousand miles square. Many topographical, geological, atmospheric and biological variations can occur within any contiguous thousand square miles. For instance, GCM's might average rainfall amounts and wind velocity over large diverse land surfaces which could include arid mountain plateaus, low-land deserts and temperate coastal rainforests. But, even modest topographic changes - for instance, a new housing development that paves over farmland and drains a wetland area - could render a model of land-surface interactions inaccurate.\nResulting Model Breakdowns.\nGiven the limitations noted, GCMs simply cannot reliably reproduce climate systems. Commonplace events like precipitation and the passage of typical weather fronts are difficult enough to depict; truly complex phenomena, such as, hurricanes, thunderstorms, and tornadoes may be represented so poorly that they simply cannot be relied upon. El Ni\u0146o, La Ni\u0146a and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation are examples of complex climate patterns that are inadequately reproduced or completely absent in GCMs.\nIn addition, global average temperature is measured by three different instruments - ground-based thermometers, weather balloons and global satellite observations - with each system covering a slightly different range of the earth's atmosphere. The data they provide is conflicting. Whereas, both the global satellite network and weather balloon observations show a modest cooling trend during the past 25 years, the ground-based thermometers show a modest warming of approximately 0.13 degrees Celsius per decade.\nThe GCMs display two flaws related to measured global temperatures. First, they show global temperatures rising across all levels of the atmosphere, a finding not reflected in reality. [See figure.] Second, the lowest predicted global temperature measurement of the GCMs is nearly three times more than the temperature rise measured by ground-based thermometers. Thus, the GCMs do not reflect the temperature differences or the direction of temperature change within various levels of the atmosphere, nor do they show the actual amount of temperature change.\nFinally, GCMs ignore the interconnected nature of climate processes and how an inaccurate simulation of one introduces errors into every other related process. A simple model for precipitation involves scores of variables. But a single error, say in representing atmospheric moisture or deciding what mechanism is causing precipitation, will make the simulation \"wrong.\" For example, precipitation requires moisture in the atmosphere and a mechanism to force it to condense (i.e., by forcing the air to rise over mountains, by surface heating, as a result of weather fronts or by cyclonic rotation). Any errors in representing either the atmospheric moisture content or the precipitation-causing mechanisms will produce an erroneous simulation. Thus, GCM simulations of precipitation will be affected by limitations in the representation and simulation of topography.\nInaccuracies in simulating precipitation will, in turn, adversely affect the simulation of virtually every other climate variable. Condensation releases heat to the atmosphere and forms clouds, which reflect energy from the sun and trap heat from the earth's surface - and both sources of heat affect air temperature. This in turn affects winds, atmospheric pressure and atmospheric circulation. Since winds drive the upper currents of the ocean, the simulation of ocean circulation also is adversely affected. Additionally, inadequate simulations of precipitation lead to inaccurate assessments of soil moisture. Since vegetation also responds to precipitation, the entire representation of the biosphere becomes open to question. This is not to say that climate scientists lack skill or dedication; it is to reiterate the extraordinary difficulty of producing accurate climate models.\nMore than just long-term average and seasonal variations go into estimating the extent of climate change. Climate change is likely to manifest itself in small regional fluctuations. Moreover, year-to-year variability is important. Much of the character of the earth's climate is in how it varies over time. GCMs that simulate essentially the same conditions year after year, as virtually all climate models do, miss an important aspect of the earth's climate. Thus GCMs' predictive powers must be evaluated in light of each model's ability to represent the global climate's holistic and variable nature.\nAlthough GCMs are not weather prediction models, climate is nevertheless an ensemble of weather events. The utility of a climate model is not in predicting whether it will rain in northern Florida on a certain afternoon. What is of interest is to determine the long-term probability that future precipitation will be significantly different - in frequency and/or intensity - from what it is today. Will the winter of 2048 be warmer or colder, wetter or drier than present conditions, and if so, by how much? If climate models cannot simulate processes known to drive daily weather patterns, to what degree can GCM's climate predictions be believed?\nConclusion.\nClimate is to some degree a representation of the average of weather events that occur. If the frequency and locations of weather events are simulated inaccurately or not at all, the reliability of climate change prognostications is undermined. While GCMs cannot be expected to simulate future weather, they should be able to accurately depict the earth's present climate and vitality. Since they cannot, GCM predictions of climate change are statistical exercises with little bearing on reality.\nWorld leaders are making critical decisions based upon predictions of General Circulation Models or Global Climate Models (GCMs) that humans are causing global climate change or global warming. Global climate models attempt to describe the earth's climate and are used in variety of applications. These include the investigation of the possible causes of climate change and the simulation of past and future climates. But these models are limited in important ways, including:", "title": "Brief Analysis 396, Limitations of Climate Models as Predictors of Climate Change", "url": "http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba/ba396/", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20020527010205/http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba/ba396/"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Also see the archival list of the Essays on Science and Society.\nBEYOND THE IVORY TOWER:\nThe Scientific Consensus on Climate Change\nPolicy-makers and the media, particularly in the United States, frequently assert that climate science is highly uncertain. Some have used this as an argument against adopting strong measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, while discussing a major U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report on the risks of climate change, then-EPA administrator Christine Whitman argued, \"As [the report] went through review, there was less consensus on the science and conclusions on climate change\" (1). Some corporations whose revenues might be adversely affected by controls on carbon dioxide emissions have also alleged major uncertainties in the science (2). Such statements suggest that there might be substantive disagreement in the scientific community about the reality of anthropogenic climate change. This is not the case.\nThe scientific consensus is clearly expressed in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental Programme, IPCC's purpose is to evaluate the state of climate science as a basis for informed policy action, primarily on the basis of peer-reviewed and published scientific literature (3). In its most recent assessment, IPCC states unequivocally that the consensus of scientific opinion is that Earth's climate is being affected by human activities: \"Human activities ... are modifying the concentration of atmospheric constituents ... that absorb or scatter radiant energy. ... [M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations\" [p. 21 in (4)].\nIPCC is not alone in its conclusions. In recent years, all major scientific bodies in the United States whose members' expertise bears directly on the matter have issued similar statements. For example, the National Academy of Sciences report, Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions, begins: \"Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise\" [p. 1 in (5)]. The report explicitly asks whether the IPCC assessment is a fair summary of professional scientific thinking, and answers yes: \"The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue\" [p. 3 in (5)].\nOthers agree. The American Meteorological Society (6), the American Geophysical Union (7), and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) all have issued statements in recent years concluding that the evidence for human modification of climate is compelling (8).\nThe drafting of such reports and statements involves many opportunities for comment, criticism, and revision, and it is not likely that they would diverge greatly from the opinions of the societies' members. Nevertheless, they might downplay legitimate dissenting opinions. That hypothesis was tested by analyzing 928 abstracts, published in refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003, and listed in the ISI database with the keywords \"climate change\" (9).\nThe 928 papers were divided into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Of all the papers, 75% fell into the first three categories, either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position.\nAdmittedly, authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point.\nThis analysis shows that scientists publishing in the peer-reviewed literature agree with IPCC, the National Academy of Sciences, and the public statements of their professional societies. Politicians, economists, journalists, and others may have the impression of confusion, disagreement, or discord among climate scientists, but that impression is incorrect.\nThe scientific consensus might, of course, be wrong. If the history of science teaches anything, it is humility, and no one can be faulted for failing to act on what is not known. But our grandchildren will surely blame us if they find that we understood the reality of anthropogenic climate change and failed to do anything about it.\nMany details about climate interactions are not well understood, and there are ample grounds for continued research to provide a better basis for understanding climate dynamics.

An embassy official said the area's security was not breached during the attacks.\nPolice said one of the bombs contained about 400 kilograms (882 pounds) of explosive.\nInsurgent attacks have continued in several areas of Iraq in advance of national elections set for January 30. U.S. and Iraqi officials have characterized the violence as an attempt to derail that vote.\nDefeated in Mosul\nU.S. military officials said Saturday that coalition and Iraqi forces had defeated insurgents who attacked four police stations in Mosul the day before.\nThe insurgents were trying to seize the police stations and destabilize Mosul with coordinated attacks, the officials said.\nAlso, U.S. and Iraqi troops killed at least 12 insurgents Friday in a battle that started when a U.S. patrol in western Mosul came under sustained fire, the U.S. military said.\nOther developments\nTwo U.S. soldiers were killed Saturday in separate attacks. One soldier was killed and another wounded when a roadside bomb exploded near Ghalibiya, just west of Baquba, U.S. military officials said. The bomb was targeting a U.S. convoy, officials said. The other soldier was killed by a bomb in eastern Baghdad.

John Abizaid, head of U.S. Central Command, said. ''And while the Iraqi troops are larger in number than they used to be, those forces have to be seasoned more, trained more. So, it's necessary to bring more American forces.''\nAbizaid, speaking to reporters at a regional security conference in Bahrain, declined to speculate on when the Iraqi forces would be ready or say how many they now number. But he said they were, ''constantly improving.''\nSaturday's car bombs in Baghdad went off nearly simultaneously at about 9:30 a.m. by a police station across the street from a checkpoint leading to the heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses the offices of Iraq's interim government and several foreign missions.\nBursts of automatic fire followed the thunderous detonation, which shook windows several hundred yards away in buildings on the opposite side of the Tigris River.\nHealth officials said the bodies of seven people killed by the blast and 59 wounded were brought to two Baghdad hospitals. Officials said most of the victims were police officers, but the identities of all the dead were not yet known.\nAdel Hassan, a policeman who survived the attack with head injuries, said at a hospital crammed with victims that a ''suicide car bomber sped into our place (the police station) ... and then there was an explosion.''\nThe interim government's security forces are regular targets for insurgents, who have been ramping up attacks ahead of scheduled Jan. 30 elections. Hundreds of police officers and members of the Iraqi National Guard have been killed in strikes by insurgents, who regard the police as collaborators with foreign occupiers.\nThe latest attacks, however, were particularly audacious and sent a clear message that the insurgents can strike wherever they choose. The police station hit Saturday was just yards from the seat of American and Iraqi power in the country. On Friday, 11 carloads of gunmen attacked a police station, killing 16 policemen, on highway to Baghdad's international airport, which has been extremely dangerous despite frequent patrols by U.S. troops.\nIn an eastern district of Baghdad, a roadside bomb killed an American soldier and wounded five others Saturday, the military said. Another bomb near the town of Ghalabiyah, 6 miles west of the insurgent hotbed of Baqouba, north of Baghdad, hit a truck in a U.S. military convoy, killing a soldier and wounding another, Master Sgt. Robert Powell said.\nA suicide car bomb hit an American forward operating base near Iraq's border with Jordan on Friday, killing two U.S. service members, the U.S. command said Saturday. A Marine spokesman said the attack had been directed at members of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force.\nIraq closed its Karameh border crossing into Jordan until further notice, Jordanian officials said Saturday.\nThe killings along with two Americans killed in roadside bombs in Baghdad and Kirkuk on Friday brought the number of U.S. military members to have died since the war began in March 2003 to at least 1,269, according to an Associated Press count.\nPolice in the northern city of Samarra also came under attack Saturday. Mortars were fired at a station after midnight, wounding two officers. Gunmen injured two policemen in another attack at about 10 a.m., according to police Maj. Sadoon Ahmed Matroud.\nNew details emerged about heavy fighting in the last day in Mosul, the northern Iraqi city that has seen a surge in violence recently, including attacks in which insurgents captured and looted several police stations.\nThe military said that in Friday's clashes, insurgents attacked four police stations but were repelled. About 70 guerrillas also tried to ambush a U.S. patrol with roadside bombs, rocket-propelled grenades and small-arms fire. After regrouping, U.S. and Iraqi forces launched an assault on ''pockets of resistance'' in Mosul, killing more than two dozen insurgents.\nThe visiting NATO commander expressed surprise Friday that Iraq's insurgency had proven so resilient by comparison with Afghanistan, where he said security has improved significantly.\n''At the beginning I would have projected the opposite, with Iraq coming along faster,'' said U.S. Gen. James Jones, the supreme allied commander in Europe.\nIn Kirkuk, U.S. soldiers killed an Iraqi driver who didn't slow down at a checkpoint set up following a rocket propelled grenade attack on a liquor store, Iraqi police and the U.S. military said Saturday.\nAn investigation has been launched into the killing, which involved soldiers from the 1st Infantry Division's 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment.\nElsewhere, Japan's top defense official, Yoshinori Ono, traveled to Iraq to visit Japanese troops on a humanitarian mission.\nTokyo must soon decide whether to extend its military dispatch to Iraq, but it is widely expected to approve an extension beyond a Dec. 14 deadline for the 550 Japanese troops based in the southern Iraqi city of Samawah.\nThe non-combat mission, launched early this year, is Japan's first military deployment to a combat zone since World War II ended.", "title": "Car bomb in Baghdad kills 7, mostly police, day after 16 officers are killed", "url": "http://www.boston.com/dailynews/339/world/Car_bomb_in_Baghdad_kills_7_mo:.shtml", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041208201921/http://www.boston.com/dailynews/339/world/Car_bomb_in_Baghdad_kills_7_mo:.shtml"}]}

Read about it and send a free protest fax to the World Bank.\nVisit the MST's Portuguese website at www.mst.org.br. The Brazilian Landless Workers Movement is the largest social movement in Latin America and one of the most successful grassroots movements in the world. Hundreds of thousands of landless peasants have taken onto themselves the task of carrying out a long-overdue land reform in a country mired by an overly skewed land distribution pattern. Less than 3% of the population owns two-thirds of Brasil's arable land. While 60% of Brasil's farmland lies idle, 25 million peasants struggle to survive by working in temporary agricultural jobs. The Landless Workers' Movement (MST) is a response to these inequalities. In 1985, with the support of the Catholic Church, hundreds of landless rural Brasilians took over an unused plantation in the south of the country and successfully established a cooperative there. They gained title to the land in 1987. Today more than 250,000 families have won land titles to over 15 million acres after MST land takeovers. In 1999 alone, 25,099 families occupied unproductive land. There are currently 71,472 families in encampments throughout Brazil awaiting government recognition. The success of the MST lies in its ability to organize. Its members have not only managed to secure land, thereby guaranteeing food security for their families, but have come up with an alternative socio-economic development model that puts people before profits. This is transforming the face of Brasil's countryside and Brasilian politics at large. These gains have not come without a cost, however. Violent clashes between the MST and police, as well as landowners, have become commonplace, claiming the lives of many peasants and their leaders. In the past 10 years, more than 1000 people have been killed as a result of land conflicts in Brasil. Prior to August 1999, only 53 of the suspected murders have been brought to trial. The MST has resisted this repression and has been able to gather support from a broad international network of human rights groups, religious organizations, and labor unions. It has received a number of international awards, including The Right Livelihood Award and an education award from UNICEF. In order to maximize production, the MST has created 60 food cooperatives as well as a small agricultural industries. Their literacy program involves 600 educators who presently work with adults and adolescents. The movement also monitors 1,000 primary schools in their settlements, in which 2,000 teachers work with about 50,000 kids.

A nova gera\u00e7\u00e3o do Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST), a primeira nascida nos acampamentos e formada nas escolas da organiza\u00e7\u00e3o, chegou ao poder. \u00c0 frente da massa de agricultores, de microfone na m\u00e3o, ou nas fileiras de sem-terra, eles s\u00e3o um ex\u00e9rcito de 50 mil militantes com um perfil \u00fanico na hist\u00f3ria do pa\u00eds. O mais vistoso deles, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Rodrigues, de 23 anos, criado no Pontal do Paranapanema, o barril de p\u00f3lvora do oeste paulista, estava na reuni\u00e3o da quarta-feira 2, quando o presidente da Rep\u00fablica botou na cabe\u00e7a o bon\u00e9 da organiza\u00e7\u00e3o que um dia antes havia feito quatro ref\u00e9ns no saque a um caminh\u00e3o de comida em Pernambuco. Lula fez jogo de compadre, como \u00e9 pr\u00f3prio de seu estilo, mas n\u00e3o deu certo. O MST continuou com as a\u00e7\u00f5es e os ruralistas mais exaltados tiveram a desculpa que faltava para armar os jagun\u00e7os. Os ministros explicaram e explicaram a atitude do chefe, mas n\u00e3o convenceram. Com bon\u00e9 na cabe\u00e7a e dando biscoito na boca das lideran\u00e7as, Lula pisou na bola. Essa, ali\u00e1s, tamb\u00e9m presente do MST.\nA oposi\u00e7\u00e3o aprovou o pedido de abertura de uma CPI para investigar a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o. O l\u00edder do PSDB no Senado, Arthur Virg\u00edlio, afirmou que o ato de Lula foi 'uma sinistra e perigosa escalada, que o governo tolera de maneira licenciosa, da agressividade do MST'. O ministro da Casa Civil, Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, saiu rapidamente em defesa, 'surpreso com a repercuss\u00e3o negativa'. 'Aonde o presidente vai, ele tem colocado diferentes bon\u00e9s de for\u00e7as sociais. N\u00e3o ajuda o Brasil querer estigmatizar o MST', tergiversou. O presidente do PFL, senador Jorge Bornhausen, n\u00e3o perdeu a chance de tripudiar. 'Um presidente n\u00e3o pode tomar partido de nenhuma fac\u00e7\u00e3o. Imagina se ele tivesse botado um chap\u00e9u da UDR', alfinetou. Com o gesto de Lula, as labaredas do campo atingiram Bras\u00edlia.\nApesar de proclamarem respeito ao passado do presidente eleito, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Rodrigues e seus colegas da nova gera\u00e7\u00e3o do MST acreditam que o pa\u00eds s\u00f3 muda com uma revolu\u00e7\u00e3o socialista.

Estima-se que em cada dez garotos, filhos de assentados, dois v\u00e3o para a milit\u00e2ncia. Os outros permanecem na lavoura. Desde que Lula tomou posse, esses militantes n\u00e3o deram tr\u00e9gua ao governo. De janeiro a junho, foram 117 invas\u00f5es em 23 Estados. E 13 as mortes no campo, contra 20 no ano passado inteiro.\nCom o gesto de Lula, o MST conseguiu o que queria: botar a reforma agr\u00e1ria no topo da agenda nacional. Os epis\u00f3dios da semana passada foram apenas o cl\u00edmax de uma s\u00e9rie de evolu\u00e7\u00f5es no tabuleiro de xadrez do pa\u00eds. No Rio Grande de Sul, 800 manifestantes marcham pelas estradas h\u00e1 tr\u00eas semanas para ocupar uma fazenda desapropriada pelo governo e embargada pela Justi\u00e7a. H\u00e1 15 dias, os sem-terra tomaram 11 postos de ped\u00e1gio em rodovias no Paran\u00e1. Na semana passada, os agricultores promoveram quatro saques a caminh\u00f5es nas estradas de Pernambuco. Em Alagoas, 400 militantes do MST entraram nos escrit\u00f3rios das companhias Ceal e Casal, que fornecem energia el\u00e9trica e \u00e1gua para o Estado. Manifestantes do MTA, outra organiza\u00e7\u00e3o camponesa, ocuparam a sede do Incra em Cuiab\u00e1, onde 400 fam\u00edlias permanecem acampadas. Em Presidente Epit\u00e1cio, no interior paulista, Jos\u00e9 Rainha j\u00e1 reuniu 3.600 fam\u00edlias em um superacampamento. Pretende organizar uma caravana rumo a Presidente Prudente, a cidade mais rica da regi\u00e3o. No lado oposto da trincheira, os fazendeiros promovem uma escalada armamentista que est\u00e1 sob investiga\u00e7\u00e3o da Pol\u00edcia Federal.

Ford attempted to confront his team leader several times without success, and eventually went to his commanding officer Captain Victor Artiga in order to file a formal complaint. According to Ford, instead of an investigation being conducted, he was given thirty seconds by Captain Artiga to retract his complaint. When Ford didn't comply, he was immediately stripped of his weapon and assigned a 24-hour escort. Shortly after he was told to report to an army psychiatrist for a \"combat stress evaluation\". The psychiatrist deemed Ford to be \"completely normal\" and filed her report with Captain Artiga. ", "According to a witness, Sergeant First Class Michael Marciello, when Artiga saw the psychiatrist's report, Artiga was, \"livid\". He \"stormed\" back to the psychiatrist and \"browbeat\" her to change her report to read that Ford was mentally unstable, and ordered her to have Ford shipped out of the country. Ford was later strapped to a medical gurney and medvac'd out of Iraq. He was initially sent to Kuwait and eventually to Landstuhl, Germany. Ford then underwent psychological evaluation in Germany and also two bases in the United States for approximately 8 months.", "David DeBatto indicated he reviewed hundreds of documents regarding Ford's case and couldn't find any of the required documents that should be filed when a soldier is medvac'd from one area to another. David also stated that every doctor that evaluated Ford found him to be completely normal, with absolutely no psychological or mental health issues.", "DeBatto reported that Ford was not the only soldier to have this happen to him. According to Col. C. Tsai, a military psychiatrist who examined Ford at the Army Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, there had been three or four other soldiers who had been sent there under very similar circumstances. Specifically, the soldiers had made allegations of abuse or mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners. DeBatto indicated he had even came across a decorated veteran from the first Gulf War who made allegations and has committed to a mental ward in Kentucky. According to DeBatto, that officer is still fighting his committal.  Tsai had found nothing at all unstable about Ford.", "DeBatto reported that Ford was eventually given an honorable discharge in February, 2004. He is currently looking into filing civil and criminal charges against the officers involved.

A Debate on the Future of Organized Labor Is Puerto Rico the Florida of 2004? Intel Agent Strapped to Gurney and Flown Out of Iraq by U.S. Army After Reporting Torture of Detainees A veteran sergeant who told his commanding officers that he witnessed his colleagues torturing Iraqi detainees was strapped to a gurney and flown out of Iraq - even though there was nothing wrong with him. We speak with the reporter - former U.S. former U.S. Army counterintelligence agent David DeBatto - who broke the story. Over the past few weeks, the number of different account of torture and abuse by the United States has been staggering. Here is a quick run-down of some of the most recent: - The Pentagon warned intelligence specialists as recently as June not to report the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. - FBI agents witnessed US soldiers abusing detainees at Guantanamo Bay as early 2002 but the Pentagon did little to investigate the complaints. - New photographs emerge showing U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi detainees as early as May 2003. - The U.S. government argues it has the right to use evidence gained by torture in deciding whether to detain people at Guantanamo Bay. - U.S. generals in Iraq were warned more than a month before the Abu Ghraib scandal emerged that detainees were being beaten and abused in Iraq. - The Red Cross accuses the U.S. pf physical and psychological torture at Guantanamo. - The US government is leasing a special Gulfstream Jet to transport detained suspects to other nations that routinely use torture in their prisons. Those are just some of the latest accounts of torture and abuse in the press over the last weeks. Over the next four years, more are certain to emerge with the nomination of Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General. Gonzales helped pave the legal groundwork that led to the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib. In 2002 he claimed in a memo that the war on terrorism renders obsolete portions of the Geneva Conventions. But perhaps the most extraordinary story of torture and abuse is the one we will hear about today. On June 15, 2003, Sgt. Frank \"Greg\" Ford, a counterintelligence agent in the National Guard stationed in Samarra told his commanding officer, Capt. Victor Artiga, that he had witnessed five incidents of torture and abuse of Iraqi detainees at his base, and requested a formal investigation. Thirty-six hours later, Ford, a 49-year-old with over 30 years of military service in the Coast Guard, Army and Navy, was ordered by U.S. Army medical personnel to lie down on a gurney. He was then strapped down, loaded onto a military plane and medevac\"d to a military medical center outside the country - even though there was nothing wrong with him. We are joined right now by the reporter who broke the story. David DeBatto, author and former U.S. Army counterintelligence agent who served in Iraq. He is currently working on a a four-part fiction series \"CI Team Red: An Army Counterintelligence Novel\", which is due out in May 2005. Will the AFL-CIO Split? A Debate on the Future of Organized Labor A handful of top national labor union leaders have threatened to split away from the powerful AFL-CIO and set up a new labor alliance unless the parent body adopts new policies to stem decades of decline in union membership. We host a debate with spokespeople from the Communications Workers of America and Unite Here. A major review of the organization and direction of the labor movement is currently underway following President Bush\"s reelection. A meeting of major union leaders last month was called by AFL-CIO president John Sweeney to debate the future of the movement. While all sides agreed something must be done to stem decades of decline in union membership, there are sharp disagreements over what strategy should be taken. In an unprecedented move, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Unite Here and others have banded together into a group called the New Unity Partnership. They claim that organized labor's current crisis is so profound that the union movement can be saved only by a total overhaul of the AFL-CIO and have threatened to split from the federation unless new policies are adopted. Andrew Stern, the president of SEIU, has promoted a 10-point plan for change with a brochure, a sophisticated Web site and a blog. Key to the plan is a proposal to consolidate the AFL-CIO's 60 unions into fewer than 20 and for using the $25 million in yearly profits from its credit card program to mount a nationwide campaign to unionize Wal-Mart to improve workers\" wages and benefits. Today we host a debate on the future of organized labor. Chris Chafe, Chief of Staff and Political Director at Unite Here. Bob Master, Political Director of Communications Workers of America in District 1 and co-chair of the Working Families Party. Bill Fletcher, President of TransAfrica. He formally served as Education Director and Assistant to the President of the AFL-CIO. Is Puerto Rico the Florida of 2004? The fight over Puerto Rico's gubernatorial election more than a month ago has brought the issue of the island's official relationship with the United States front and center once again. We go to Puerto Rico to speak with independent political analyst Juan Manuel Garcia-Passalacqua. Some are calling it one of the most significant political battles in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. But instead of bullets, this time the battle is being fought with ballots. The fight over Puerto Rico's gubernatorial election more than a month ago has brought the issue of the island's official relationship with the United States front and center once again. For some observers, the election controversy in Puerto Rico evokes images from the controversy surrounding Florida in the 2000 US election. There are multiple court battles, recounts and, depending on who you ask, a lot at stake. On one side of the official battle is the Popular Democratic Party candidate Anibal Acevedo Vila, whose party favors the status quo of free association with the United States. On the other side is the New Progressive Party and its candidate, former two-term Gov. Pedro Rossello. They favor US statehood for Puerto Rico. Also in the mix are the tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who want full independence. When partial election results were certified, Vila's party held a 3,800 vote lead. But Rossello's party cried foul and said that some 7,000 ballots had not been properly counted. The contested votes are so-called double-split ballots that have both a voter's mark under a party insignia and marks for governor and resident commissioner from a different party. The resident commissioner is Puerto Rico's nonvoting representative in the U.S. Congress, a position held by Vila for the last four years. Both parties have since also reported irregularities at voting places, including one in the northern town of Guaynabo where more ballots were cast than the number of registered voters. The NPP, the statehood party, says the split ballots should not be counted. The PDP, which favors retaining Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. territory, says they should be counted. Puerto Rico's State Election Committee ruled they were valid votes and should be counted, and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court ordered them counted. But here is where a major twist enters the picture. The United States District Court judge in San Juan said those contested ballots must be separated from the recount, until that same court determines whether they are valid. The case now goes to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, where a three-judge panel will hear arguments Monday regarding whether the federal courts have jurisdiction in Puerto Rico's election.

{"title": "Lycos Europe ends its anti-spam campaign", "text": ["{{byline|datehe company started distributing a [[w:screensaver|screensaver]] on November 29, 2004 on [http://makelovenotspam.com makelovenotspam.com]. Once installed, the computer would send HTTP requests to spammers' servers when not in use. The intent was to raise the running costs of those servers. Lycos coordinated these requests by choosing targets from lists generated by organizations such as [http://www.spamcop.com Spamcop.com]. The servers were monitored so as to keep them under heavy load, but alive. ", "Security experts roundly criticized the program. Steve Linford, director of a non-profit anti-spam organization SpamHaus, and Graham Cluley, a senior technology consultant of Sophos, pointed out that lowering moral standards to fight spammers was not a good idea. The legality of attacking the servers was also debated since it resembles \"[[w:Denial-of-service attack|Distributed Denial of Service]]\" attacks (DDoS), except that Lycos did not completely shut down the target servers. ", "Other troubles arose. The day after the campaign was launched, there was an alleged takeover of the web site's top page by a cracker. The page was replaced with a warning against the use of the screensaver, according to a screenshot sent via email to the Finnish security firm F-Secure. A Lycos spokesperson said that the screenshot was a hoax: there was no trace of intrusion in the server log and the site was simply unavailable due to a high demand.  ", "Some Internet service providers blocked either the traffic to Lycos-Europe, or the requests generated by the screensaver. ", "Next, one of the targeted sites redirected all traffic to the Lycos' server, making Lycos itself a target. The company had maintained that its server was immune from the attack.  Lycos stopped distributing the program on December 3, 2004 and asked clients to \"stay tuned.\" The company later ended the program. ", "On December 6, F-Secure reported a virus email disguised as the anti-spam screensaver. When its attachment (a zip file) is opened, it self-extracts and installs a \"[[w:Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]]\" --harmful program disguised as legitimate software.  The Trojan horse was set up to monitor keystrokes in order to steal passwords, bank account numbers and other important information. ", "Lycos' software had been downloaded more than 100,000 times by the end of the campaign.

This program for Windows or MacOS constantly visits websites for which spam has been sent. \"The more users download and use the screen saver, the lower the performance of the sites sending out the spam, and the greater the costs for the operators,\" Lycos explained. Apparently, the portal operator is banking on a large number of its European users - 20 million according to its own figures - to actually download the screen saver. If it is activated, it shows a map indicating where the web server currently being attacked is located. Various permanently displayed live data show how many users are currently taking part in the attack and whether the performance of the server under attack is suffering to the extent desired. Currently, Lycos is waging war against the notorious spammers blacklisted at Spamcop. According to Joerg Heidrich, a legal consultant at Heise Zeitschriften Verlag, Lycos' call on people to take matters into their own hands is questionable at best. The general consensus among lawyers is that an intentional DoS attack with the aim of taking servers out of commission constitutes a manipulation of data in accordance with Section 303a as well as computer sabotage in accordance with 303b of the German Penal Code. Heidrich did, however, doubt that these laws apply if the servers under attack are not shut down, but their performance merely inhibited, as intended in the Lycos project. Regardless of how the penal code will be interpreted in this case, Heidrich stated that Lycos is committing an encroachment of business operation according to Section 823 of the German Civil Code as well as malicious damage according to Section 826 of the German Civil Code. However, claims for damages based on the civil code would require the spammers to reveal their identity.

To limit the chance of mistakes being made, Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods.\nAs these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs, the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive, said Mr Pollmann.\nSites will also slow down under the weight of data requests. Early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85%.\nUsers do not have to be registered users of Lycos to download and use the screensaver.\nWhile working, the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data.\nThe screensaver is due to be launched across Europe on 1 December and before now has only been trialled in Sweden.\nDespite the soft launch, Mr Pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days.\n\"There's a huge user demand to not only filter spam day-by-day but to do something more,\" he said \"Before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive.\"", "title": "Screensaver tackles spam websites", "url": "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4051553.stm", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20050417122746/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4051553.stm"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Older News: November of 2004\nSaturday, November 20, 2004\nYanz worm Posted by Katrin @ 13:20 GMT\nThere was some media attention in Asia on the Yanz.A worm.

If you see it, don't install it on your phone. It will make the smartphone features of your phone useless, so you can still make calls with the phone but that's it, no messages, no web, no applications. Recovery could get tricky, especially if you don't have a third-party file manager software already installed on your phone.\nThe most obvious symptom of the trojan is that the typical programs on the phone won't work any more, and that their icons get replaced with a a picture of a skull. See below:\nUpgrading Sober.I to Radar2 Posted by Katrin @ 09:44 GMT\nDue to increased number of reports we just upgraded Sober.I to Radar level 2.\nThe worm sends e-mail messages with English and German texts. Here's an example of a English message sent by the worm:\nNew Symbian trojan discovered. Posted by Jarno @ 09:42 GMT\nWe've received a new trojan that affects the popular new phones running Symbian Series 60 .\nSymbOS/Skulls is a malicious SIS file that installs copies of Symbian system components on the C: drive of the device, and includes corrupted AIF (Symbian application info and icon file) for each file.\nThese installed System files then override the ROM versions in the start order, and prevent any of the symbian system tools being used. Thus rendering all but the phone functions of the phone useless.\nWe will publish more information and Anti-Virus updates for F-Secure Mobile Anti-Virus for Symbian shortly.\nNew Sober Posted by Katrin @ 07:39 GMT\nWe are getting reports of a new Sober.I variant. We have just published detection of it with update: Version=2004-11-19_01\nMore information will follow.\nThursday, November 18, 2004\nRepacked version of Cabir.B found Posted by Jarno @ 08:17 GMT\nA repacked version of Cabir.B Symbian worm has been found on Chinese web portal. The repacked sample contains binaries that are fully indetical to original Cabir.B so it's not a new variant. However the new SIS installation file contains different settings as the one created by Cabir.B, which cause it to install the worm into different directory and display pop-up text during installation.\nThis repacked version is detected by F-Secure Mobile Anti-Virus for Series 60 without any need for database updates.\nThanks for Alex Lucic for notifying us about the repacked version.\nWednesday, November 17, 2004\nAnother virus writer caught & sentenced Posted by Mikko @ 21:16 GMT\nIt's been the best year ever in catching virus writers.\nAnother virus writer has been convicted, this time in a little-known Russian republic of Udmurtia. Mr. Eugene Suchkov was sentenced for a fine of 3000 roubles for virus writing.\nThis wouldn't be too interesting, unless Mr. Suchkov wouldn't also be known as a member of 29A, one of the best-known active virus-writing groups. Turns out Mr. Suchkov is also known as \"Whale\" and author of several viruses he has released as a 29A member, including viruses targeting .NET systems.\nAs discussed earlier in our weblog, other 29A members have recently been in the headlines too.\nNational computer security days Posted by Mikko @ 11:30 GMT\nWe got a note from a reader that today, the 17th of November, is National Computer Security Day in Ireland. This is the first time Government of Ireland has organized such a day together with various other organizations and companies. For more information, see their website at www.makeitsecure.ie.\nFinland had a similar National Data Security Day in February and will have another one in 2005. In addition, we're aware of at least two other countries planning similar events.\nThe main practical message of these days is simple: Get a firewall! Get an antivirus! Patch your system!\nWhich of course means that the real target group of these days is not you or us (obviously you're a pretty aware computer user since you're reading our blog). The real target is the grandmamas and the newbies - the great masses of the net users.

The emails have the subject \"Latest News about Arafat!!!\" and come with two attachments, one clean JPEG and an infected EMF.\nThe clean image looks like this:\nThe EMF exploits the MS04-032 (EMF) vulnerabilty to install the worm to the system when the attachment is opened. It's worth mentioning that Aler does not propagate through this vulnerabilty. It spreads to random computers using local credentials from the infected host and a list of weak passwords.\nAler comes with a TCP proxy as payload.\nDescription of the worm has been posted to\nhttp://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/aler.shtml\nGot first snow!

Prosecutors claimed this virus infected over 48000 computers.\nMr. Parson confessed writing the virus in trial in August 2004.\nMr. Parson, who is 19 years old, could face jail time anywhere up to 3 years. He might also be ordered to pay compensation charges. When arrested, Parson had $3 USD in his savings account.\nThe creator of the original Blaster worm remains a mystery.\nThursday, November 11, 2004\nSome MyDooms renamed to Bofra Posted by Gergo @ 13:18 GMT\nEven though they seem to originate from the same source code, some samples we called MyDoom earlier have been renamed to Bofra. More specifically this affects MyDoom.AG, MyDoom.AH and MyDoom.AI.\nThe Bofra family of worms uses a different way of propagation which we explained in this earlier post.\nA link page for the Bofra family has been posted to\nhttp://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/bofra.shtml\nWednesday, November 10, 2004\nMalware graph posters Posted by Ero @ 18:44 GMT\nThanks to all our readers for the feedback we received on the malware graphs.\nGiven your response we decided we will be doing the posters.

This alleged members of a Russian mob was arrested with $200,000 worth of stolen merchandise, credit card scanning equipment, more than 100 ID cards with fraudulently obtained information and nearly $15,000 in cash.\nAuthorities are fighting credit card fraud more and more visibly.

In this occasion only one update has been released, (MS04-039), fixing a vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000 or Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0.\nDetailed info from Microsoft is available at TechNet Security .\nF-Secure does recommend to the users of products affected by the update to upgrade their system by visiting Windows Update .\nMore on the new IFRAME worms Posted by Mikko @ 08:30 GMT\nTurns out these new Mydoom.AG and Mydoom.AH variants might not be Mydooms at all. Our comparison tools show only around 49% correlation between these and the last Mydooms. So that would explain why the technique is so different.\nThese viruses are also one of the fastest ever to take advantage of a new security vulnerability. The exploit was only posted publicly on Friday, and the viruses were out by Tuesday.\nSo the virus spreads in four steps:\n1 Infected machine (\"predator\") sends out tons of emails with a link\n2 Recipient on target machine (\"prey\") follows the link back to a website on the Infected machine\n3 Exploit on the web page downloads and runs the virus, turning the prey to another predator\n4 Repeat\nTo make this clearer, have a look at our high-tech illustration:\nVirus writer Benny/29A hired by a Czech antivirus company? Posted by Mikko @ 07:57 GMT\nAccording to an article in The Register, a Czech virus writer known as Benny has been hired by a Czech software development company, as the main developer of their new antivirus product.\nBenny is one of the most well-known virus writers, with a long history in this area, starting from 1999.\nThis development is really surprising, as obviously any antivirus company would face major credibility problems after doing such a stupid move. Nevertheless, a similar thing happened with the author of the Netsky and Sasser viruses earlier this year.\nWe here at F-Secure don't hire criminals.\nNew Mydooms, new exploits Posted by Mikko @ 06:57 GMT\nTwo new Mydoom variants have been found last night. They are considerably different from previous Mydooms.\nThey do spread over email, like Mydooms normally do. However, these new variants do not send attachments at all; instead they send emails with links to a website. There are several different emails, for example:\nCongratulations! PayPal has successfully charged $175 to your credit\ncard. Your order tracking number is 866DEC0A, and your item will be\nshipped within three business days.\nTo see details please click this link\nInterestingly, the link points to a website which is actually running on the infected machine that sent the email in the first place. The worm accomplishes this by installing a small web server on port 1639 (or similar) on each infected machine. This technique is a bit similar to what for example Blaster worm does to transfer itself to each infected machine; instead of using a central download server it turns each infected machine to one.\nEven more interestingly, the web page uses a brand new IFRAME vulnerability in Internet Explorer to infect the computer. There's no patch for Windows 2000 or XP SP1 yet. Windows XP SP2 is not vulnerable.\nHowever, so far we we haven't seen significant amounts of infections reported to us.\nWe detect these two new Mydoom variants as Mydoom.AG and Mydoom.AH with our updates published today as 2004-11-09_01.\nMonday, November 8, 2004\nBush is back (the site that is) Posted by Mikko @ 08:38 GMT\nJust a quick note that after George Bush was re-elected as the US president last week, his official homepage (www.georgewbush.com) was apparently re-opened to be accessible to the whole world. This happened some time during last weekend.\nAs we reported in our blog last week, the site was not accessible outside USA and Canada, possibly as a precaution against DDoS attacks.\nOn a related theme, out of all the voting problems reported at Voters Unite, the most interesting is probably a voting computer which was apparently using signed short integers to store the amount of absentee ballots. So after 32768 ballots, it started counting backwards. For details, see their problem tally.\nThursday, November 4, 2004\nGreeting from RSA Conference Posted by Mikko @ 21:25 GMT\nThis time it's the RSA Europe conference 2004, in Barcelona.\nVery nice conference! RSA Conference is heavily breaking away from it's roots of encryption-only event and becoming an all-in-one massive security conference. With over 1000 attendees, it's probably one of the biggest security events anywhere.\nOne major gripe though; I tried entering Bruce Schneier's presentation, and there were way too little seats. Probably a hundred people was standing in the room and many people didn't fit in at all. Many were queueing to see at least something. It felt almost like DEF CON...\nSigning off,\nMikko\nWanted by the FBI - for computer intrusion Posted by Mikko @ 01:42 GMT\nSome of you might remember this case from our weblog in last August.\nMr. Jay Echouafni, the CEO of satellite receiver reseller Orbit Communication was charged for hiring hackers to launch DDoS attacks against their competitors. Their idea was to take down the online ordering systems of other large satellite operators, using hackers from USA and UK.\nWe just noticed that Mr. Echouafni has skipped bail, and is actually now listed among the FBI's most wanted.\nThe website of Orbit Communication Corporation has been down now for some months (surprise, surprise). However, we managed to take this screenshot of their welcome page before it vanished:\nWednesday, November 3, 2004\nConfiguring Macs right Posted by Mikko @ 10:20 GMT\nIn the wake of the Opener Mac OS X malware which we reported two weeks ago, fans of either Apple or the National Security Agency will be thrilled by these news: NSA has released a very thorough 100-page guide for configuring security for Apple Mac OS X v10.3.x.\nThe guide is available for download directly from NSA.\nIt's unclassified, too.\nTuesday, November 2, 2004\nUSA votes Posted by Mikko @ 08:11 GMT\nUSA votes for their next president today.\nFor the first time in history, a major part of this voting is done on voting machines running on top of a general-purpose operating system.\nThe three largest manufacturers of voting systems (Diebold, ES&S and Sequoia) all run closed-source systems on top of Windows. You would think that voting machines would be a prime example of systems that should be open source, so anybody could verify what exactly happens and how. And there is a long list of known failures so far.\nWe might also remember that Diebold is one of the largest manufacturers of Windows-based ATMs...and that RPC and LSASS -based network worms have managed to infect such cash machines in several occasions over the last year and a half.\nSo it will be interesting to see how everything plays out.\nMonday, November 1, 2004\nVolunteers needed... Posted by Mikko @ 13:07 GMT\nThe virus statistics page we run is based on real-world virus scanning data submitted to us by our customers.\nWe're interested in expanding the amount of reporters to make our statistics more accurate. To do this, we're asking for volunteer organizations who could share their virus reports with us. We're especially looking for more reporters from USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France and Italy. Also we'd welcome more participants from Asia and Australia.\nFor more information on how you can participate please see our Virus stats information page - thanks!\nInteresting new antivirus weblog Posted by Mikko @ 13:01 GMT\nWe've just noticed that our friends at Kaspersky Lab have started their own weblog, which looks very interesting!\nCongratulations to Eugene, Costin, David and Aleks for opening the 2nd viruslab weblog in the world!\nUnlike ours, Kaspersky's weblog also allows public comments from the readers. We haven't allowed this in our weblog as we didn't want to give an open podium to virus writers. We'll see how well it works out with them.\nSome Bagle download sites becoming active Posted by Mikko @ 07:51 GMT\nThe latest Bagle variant, like most of the recent variants, contains a long list of web addresses. Infected machines periodically go through this list and try to download and run a program from there.\nThe latest site list contains 168 different web sites, located all over the world. We believe many of these sites are actually not hacked or otherwise controlled by the virus writers, but are just put in there as camouflage.\nWe've been checking the contents of the URLs over the weekend. They were all showing \"404\" until last night, when two of the URLs become active. We're now trying to shut them down and are analysing what the program that was posted there exactly does.\nIf you're a sysadmin and would like to filter access to these sites from your network, the domains in question were www.vbw.info and www.esperanzaparalafamilia.com.", "title": "F-Secure : News from the Lab", "url": "http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-112004.html#00000374", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041121021334/http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-112004.html#00000374"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "A new application from Lycos Europe aims to fight back against spammers, but some experts say the company may be enabling illegal activities.\nThe screen saver software, \"Make Love, Not Spam,\" is a distributed computing application, which activates when the user's machine is not being used. When active, it continuously generates traffic on the sites of alleged spammers, slowing them down and making them more difficult to operate.\nIn effect, Lycos is enabling its users to launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, said Anne Mitchell, president of the Institute for Spam and Internet Public Policy and noted anti-spam attorney. \"Despite Lycos' reassurance that the use of the screen saver and its contacting of the targeted Web site is not a DDoS, I remain in doubt,\" Mitchell said. \"'In fact, I could make a strong argument in court that it was exactly a DDoS.\"\nWhile Lycos considered the legal ramifications before launching the application, the company does not expect any legal trouble, according to Wessel van Rensburg, head of e-mail at Lycos UK.\n\"If there are any legal issues, we're prepared to deal with them. It's a pretty grey area. We've been careful to program it in such a way that we won't bring sites completely down. We're confident that we'll have broad public support in this,\" he said.\nMitchell argues that the entire purpose, and the user's reason for using the software, is to \"get back at the spammers\" by slowing down their machine, she said. And despite Lycos' insistence that sites will only be slowed, not completely brought down, the intent remains the same, she said.\n\"There is no legal precedent which says that it's only a DDoS if the machine is taken entirely offline,\" Mitchell said.\nThe sites to be targeted are selected from secure international black lists, which are used by leading portals and ISPs, and each target site is checked manually to ensure that it is a genuine transgressor, van Rensburg said.\nThe application has been downloaded by a few thousand users in Germany, where it launched today. It is expected to launch in the UK on Wednesday, and in the remaining 8 countries where Lycos Europe operates by the end of the week, he said.\n\"This effort, while well intentioned, exacerbates the problems we see in e-mail today,\" said Trevor Hughes, executive director of the E-mail Service Provider Coalition. \"Creating 'zombie e-mail' and 'Web drones' is never a good idea. Further, there are very real concerns that such activities may violate existing laws.\"\nThe site was unavailable for parts of the day Tuesday, which a spokesman attributed to internal system testing.", "title": "Lycos Europe Pushes Limits in Anti-Spam Fight", "url": "http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3441811", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041215092541/http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3441811"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Older News: November of 2004\nSaturday, November 20, 2004\nYanz worm Posted by Katrin @ 13:20 GMT\nThere was some media attention in Asia on the Yanz.A worm. It uses as attachment names and in its email subject and body, texts related to the Asian singer Stefanie Sun (Yanzi).\nWe did not receive reports of this worm. However, we published detection of Yanz,A worm on November 17th in update version number 2004-11-17_01\nFriday, November 19, 2004\nMore info on the new Symbian trojan Posted by Mikko @ 10:05 GMT\nWe have some isolated reports of users who've been hit by the new Skulls trojan on their phones.\nThis trojan has been distributed on some Symbian shareware download sites as \"Extended Theme Manager\" by \"Tee-222\". If you see it, don't install it on your phone. It will make the smartphone features of your phone useless, so you can still make calls with the phone but that's it, no messages, no web, no applications. Recovery could get tricky, especially if you don't have a third-party file manager software already installed on your phone.\nThe most obvious symptom of the trojan is that the typical programs on the phone won't work any more, and that their icons get replaced with a a picture of a skull. See below:\nUpgrading Sober.I to Radar2 Posted by Katrin @ 09:44 GMT\nDue to increased number of reports we just upgraded Sober.I to Radar level 2.\nThe worm sends e-mail messages with English and German texts. Here's an example of a English message sent by the worm:\nNew Symbian trojan discovered. Posted by Jarno @ 09:42 GMT\nWe've received a new trojan that affects the popular new phones running Symbian Series 60 .\nSymbOS/Skulls is a malicious SIS file that installs copies of Symbian system components on the C: drive of the device, and includes corrupted AIF (Symbian application info and icon file) for each file.\nThese installed System files then override the ROM versions in the start order, and prevent any of the symbian system tools being used. Thus rendering all but the phone functions of the phone useless.\nWe will publish more information and Anti-Virus updates for F-Secure Mobile Anti-Virus for Symbian shortly.\nNew Sober Posted by Katrin @ 07:39 GMT\nWe are getting reports of a new Sober.I variant. We have just published detection of it with update: Version=2004-11-19_01\nMore information will follow.\nThursday, November 18, 2004\nRepacked version of Cabir.B found Posted by Jarno @ 08:17 GMT\nA repacked version of Cabir.B Symbian worm has been found on Chinese web portal. The repacked sample contains binaries that are fully indetical to original Cabir.B so it's not a new variant. However the new SIS installation file contains different settings as the one created by Cabir.B, which cause it to install the worm into different directory and display pop-up text during installation.\nThis repacked version is detected by F-Secure Mobile Anti-Virus for Series 60 without any need for database updates.\nThanks for Alex Lucic for notifying us about the repacked version.\nWednesday, November 17, 2004\nAnother virus writer caught & sentenced Posted by Mikko @ 21:16 GMT\nIt's been the best year ever in catching virus writers.\nAnother virus writer has been convicted, this time in a little-known Russian republic of Udmurtia. Mr. Eugene Suchkov was sentenced for a fine of 3000 roubles for virus writing.\nThis wouldn't be too interesting, unless Mr. Suchkov wouldn't also be known as a member of 29A, one of the best-known active virus-writing groups. Turns out Mr. Suchkov is also known as \"Whale\" and author of several viruses he has released as a 29A member, including viruses targeting .NET systems.\nAs discussed earlier in our weblog, other 29A members have recently been in the headlines too.\nNational computer security days Posted by Mikko @ 11:30 GMT\nWe got a note from a reader that today, the 17th of November, is National Computer Security Day in Ireland. This is the first time Government of Ireland has organized such a day together with various other organizations and companies. For more information, see their website at www.makeitsecure.ie.\nFinland had a similar National Data Security Day in February and will have another one in 2005. In addition, we're aware of at least two other countries planning similar events.\nThe main practical message of these days is simple: Get a firewall! Get an antivirus! Patch your system!\nWhich of course means that the real target group of these days is not you or us (obviously you're a pretty aware computer user since you're reading our blog). The real target is the grandmamas and the newbies - the great masses of the net users. You really can't go wrong trying to educate them.\nTuesday, November 16, 2004\nFirst virus distributed in Extended MetaFiles Posted by Gergo @ 09:10 GMT\nThe recently found worm, Aler (A.K.A Golten) was distributed in the form of EMF files as email attachment to a number of email addresses. The emails have the subject \"Latest News about Arafat!!!\" and come with two attachments, one clean JPEG and an infected EMF.\nThe clean image looks like this:\nThe EMF exploits the MS04-032 (EMF) vulnerabilty to install the worm to the system when the attachment is opened. It's worth mentioning that Aler does not propagate through this vulnerabilty. It spreads to random computers using local credentials from the infected host and a list of weak passwords.\nAler comes with a TCP proxy as payload.\nDescription of the worm has been posted to\nhttp://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/aler.shtml\nGot first snow! Posted by Mikko @ 07:44 GMT\nWhoa! This morning we got our first snow this year here in Helsinki.\nTake a look:\nThis should make Ero Carrera really happy...as he relocated from our Helsinki viruslab to California viruslab couple of weeks ago. No snow there.\nSunday, November 14, 2004\nCatbert and camera phones Posted by Mikko @ 21:03 GMT\nScott Adams is almost always good. He masters the skill of packing two or three punchlines into one strip where others would have expanded them to several.\nHowever, today's Dilbert is particularily priceless....\nFriday, November 12, 2004\nBlaster variant author due to be sentenced today Posted by Mikko @ 13:26 GMT\nIf everything goes according to schedule, Mr. Jeffrey Parson will be senteced today for writing and distributing a variant of the Blaster worm in August 2003. Prosecutors claimed this virus infected over 48000 computers.\nMr. Parson confessed writing the virus in trial in August 2004.\nMr. Parson, who is 19 years old, could face jail time anywhere up to 3 years. He might also be ordered to pay compensation charges. When arrested, Parson had $3 USD in his savings account.\nThe creator of the original Blaster worm remains a mystery.\nThursday, November 11, 2004\nSome MyDooms renamed to Bofra Posted by Gergo @ 13:18 GMT\nEven though they seem to originate from the same source code, some samples we called MyDoom earlier have been renamed to Bofra. More specifically this affects MyDoom.AG, MyDoom.AH and MyDoom.AI.\nThe Bofra family of worms uses a different way of propagation which we explained in this earlier post.\nA link page for the Bofra family has been posted to\nhttp://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/bofra.shtml\nWednesday, November 10, 2004\nMalware graph posters Posted by Ero @ 18:44 GMT\nThanks to all our readers for the feedback we received on the malware graphs.\nGiven your response we decided we will be doing the posters. More info will follow on the weblog.\nPhisher caught again Posted by Mikko @ 12:11 GMT\nToday's Boston Herald has an interesting story on Mr. Andrew Schwarmkoff, who's been charged for credit card and identity fraud in Brighton, Boston.\nApparently Mr. Schwarmkoff sent out phishing emails to collect people's credit card and banking details. This alleged members of a Russian mob was arrested with $200,000 worth of stolen merchandise, credit card scanning equipment, more than 100 ID cards with fraudulently obtained information and nearly $15,000 in cash.\nAuthorities are fighting credit card fraud more and more visibly. Just last week the US Secret Service shut down the carderplanet.cc and shadowcrew.com carding sites.\nThanks to Jeremy Wagstaff's excellent weblog for the link to the article.\nTuesday, November 9, 2004\nNovember's Microsoft security update Posted by Ero @ 19:05 GMT\nAs usual, the second Tuesday of the month like today, Microsoft releases security updates. In this occasion only one update has been released, (MS04-039), fixing a vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000 or Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0.\nDetailed info from Microsoft is available at TechNet Security .\nF-Secure does recommend to the users of products affected by the update to upgrade their system by visiting Windows Update .\nMore on the new IFRAME worms Posted by Mikko @ 08:30 GMT\nTurns out these new Mydoom.AG and Mydoom.AH variants might not be Mydooms at all. Our comparison tools show only around 49% correlation between these and the last Mydooms. So that would explain why the technique is so different.\nThese viruses are also one of the fastest ever to take advantage of a new security vulnerability. The exploit was only posted publicly on Friday, and the viruses were out by Tuesday.\nSo the virus spreads in four steps:\n1 Infected machine (\"predator\") sends out tons of emails with a link\n2 Recipient on target machine (\"prey\") follows the link back to a website on the Infected machine\n3 Exploit on the web page downloads and runs the virus, turning the prey to another predator\n4 Repeat\nTo make this clearer, have a look at our high-tech illustration:\nVirus writer Benny/29A hired by a Czech antivirus company? Posted by Mikko @ 07:57 GMT\nAccording to an article in The Register, a Czech virus writer known as Benny has been hired by a Czech software development company, as the main developer of their new antivirus product.\nBenny is one of the most well-known virus writers, with a long history in this area, starting from 1999.\nThis development is really surprising, as obviously any antivirus company would face major credibility problems after doing such a stupid move. Nevertheless, a similar thing happened with the author of the Netsky and Sasser viruses earlier this year.\nWe here at F-Secure don't hire criminals.\nNew Mydooms, new exploits Posted by Mikko @ 06:57 GMT\nTwo new Mydoom variants have been found last night. They are considerably different from previous Mydooms.\nThey do spread over email, like Mydooms normally do. However, these new variants do not send attachments at all; instead they send emails with links to a website. There are several different emails, for example:\nCongratulations! PayPal has successfully charged $175 to your credit\ncard. Your order tracking number is 866DEC0A, and your item will be\nshipped within three business days.\nTo see details please click this link\nInterestingly, the link points to a website which is actually running on the infected machine that sent the email in the first place. The worm accomplishes this by installing a small web server on port 1639 (or similar) on each infected machine. This technique is a bit similar to what for example Blaster worm does to transfer itself to each infected machine; instead of using a central download server it turns each infected machine to one.\nEven more interestingly, the web page uses a brand new IFRAME vulnerability in Internet Explorer to infect the computer. There's no patch for Windows 2000 or XP SP1 yet. Windows XP SP2 is not vulnerable.\nHowever, so far we we haven't seen significant amounts of infections reported to us.\nWe detect these two new Mydoom variants as Mydoom.AG and Mydoom.AH with our updates published today as 2004-11-09_01.\nMonday, November 8, 2004\nBush is back (the site that is) Posted by Mikko @ 08:38 GMT\nJust a quick note that after George Bush was re-elected as the US president last week, his official homepage (www.georgewbush.com) was apparently re-opened to be accessible to the whole world.

The weaponry has had an impact, decreasing the response time of some of the targeted sites by as much as 85 percent, Lycos Europe said.\nThe enemy, however, has apparently rallied its troops in a counteroffensive.\nOn Thursday, the Make Love, Not Spam site distributing the screensaver was down, displaying only a graphic and the words \"Stay Tuned.\" Netcraft Ltd., a network-security services company in Bath, England, reported that Lycos Europe had changed the Internet address of its spam-killing site, which Netcraft said is housed at a Swedish advertising agency, called Starring, that works for the Web portal.\nEarlier in the day, security firm F-Secure Corp. reported that a spammer site called \"www.moretgage.info,\" which used to sell cheap mortgage loans, had added a \"meta refresh tag\" on its front page that redirected traffic to the screensaver site. A request for the URL did point the browser to www.makelovenotspam.com.\nLycos Europe wasn't immediately available for comment, and it was unclear whether other spammers had started redirecting traffic, or whether such a strike forced Lycos to take down its site.\nIn other developments on Thursday, Global Crossing Ltd., a telecommunications services provider, and cable operator Cox Communications Inc. appeared to have blocked access to the Lycos Europe site, Netcraft said. Cox did not have any immediate comment.\nAccording to Global Crossing: \"Global Crossing's Acceptable Use Policy prohibits denial of service attacks. As a result, we have 'black holed' the Lycos Europe Website which issues instructions to the clients participating in these attacks. 'Black holing' means we are not carrying any traffic to or from that Website on our network.\"\nSpammers defaced their enemy's site earlier in the week, replacing the home page with a screen that read, \"yes, attacking spammers is wrong, you know this, you shouldn't be doing it. Your IP address and request have been logged and will be reported to your ISP for further action,\" according to F-Secure. Lycos Europe, however, reportedly denied the defacement.\nLycos Europe's strategy of fighting fire with fire has raised questions among legal experts, who say U.S. spammers harmed by the action could take the battle to the courts.\n\"This strikes me as a denial-of-service attack and a flagrant violation of U.S. law,\" Ray Everett-Church, chief privacy officer for ePrivacyGroup.com and counsel for the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail, told InformationWeek magazine.\nLycos Europe, in its defense, has denied doing anything illegal. The company says it doesn't intend to take down the spammers' sites, but only wants to eat up bandwidth and drive up their costs.\nThe screensaver requests Web pages from servers \"verified to be spam advertising sites,\" Lycos has said.

They are best known for two recent sieges against civilians: one in a Moscow theater and one in a school in Beslan.\nChechen rebels have been operating several different websites for years. One of these sites is kavkazcenter.com, which has been a source of lots of recent controversy. This site has been a target of several network attacks (some of them reportedly originating from the ip range owned by Russian Federal Security Service FSB). The site has been closed down and kicked out from several countries, including Russia, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland.

Some companies are talking about Cabir.B being in Camtimer.sis file, while others are talking about viruses called \"Camtimer.A\" and \"Camtimer.B\". So it's time to bring some order to this mess.\nThe malware in question here is SymbOS/Cabir.B, which some 'clever' people have packed into different SIS files using a Symbian tool called makeSIS.\nPutting something into a SIS file is something like making Java JAR archive or Microsoft MSI installation file; you are making an archive file with extra information that is read by the system installer. So repacking Cabir.B into a new SIS file does not make a new Cabir variant, yet alone a new malware.\nA SIS file contains quite a lot of properties information and one can do interesting things with just a SIS file, as we have seen with Skulls.A and Skulls.B. So it is easy to get confused.\nHere's a list of Cabir.B's we have seen so far:\nCaribe.sis\nOriginal Caribe.B\n3d_OIDI500.sis\nShows pop-up text \"3d_OIDI500 by www.XXX.XXX.cn\". Renames Cabir.app into OIDI500.app and contains AIF file that changes the Cabir icon to look like a bag of gold. Renaming breaks the Cabir.B functionality. As an end result, instead of sending copies of itself via Bluetooth, it sends files with zero lenght.\nCamtimer.sis\nShows pop-up text \"This is advanced camera timer for your phone\". Installs Cabir.B and Camtimer camera timer software from Nokia. The Cabir.B is not set to start automatically on SIS install and is installed into wrong directory, so that it won't start when phone reboots. If user clicks on the icon manually, Cabir will start, and will spread as Caribe.sis - which contains only the Cabir.B executables. The same Camtimer.sis file is also found inside Skulls.B's SIS file, and is copied into system when Skulls.B is installed.\nThere exists also another version of Camtimer.SIS that some companies call Camtimer.B. We haven't got a sample of this one yet, but it appears to be almost identical to the one described above, with the exception that it installs Cabir.B into correct directory for it to start automatically. But this does not make it a new malware.\nWhen is a defacement not a defacement? Posted by Mikko @ 06:31 GMT\nContinuing on the status of the controversial www.makelovenotspam.com site: We have been discussing the case with the maintainers of this site (who are in Sweden). They've checked their systems several times and have found no evidence of a defacement or of an intrusion of any kind.\nRegardless of that, we've had several users report a defacement to us, even sending us screenshots like this:\nSo, what's happening here?\nWell, there are basically two choices. One is that some internet operators are not allowing traffic from their IP range to this website - instead, they are referring it to a site with this 'educational' message.\nThe other choice is DNS poisoning. DNS poisoning is an attack where a malicious attacker floods a domain name server with DNS requests and fake responses to them. The target is to convince a specific DNS server that domain FOO.BAR should point to 1.2.3.4 when it really should point to 9.8.7.6, or so. However, such an attack isn't global - only users behind a specific DNS server would access the wrong site. But for those users it would be nearly impossibly to notice.\nThis vulnerability has been known for ages. It used to be fairly easy to do, but then random number generators used by BIND and other DNS tools got improved, making it much harder.\nHowever, it is still doable. For more details, read a good paper on the subject, written by Joe Stewart (of LURHQ fame).\nThursday, December 2, 2004\nA re-packed Netsky variant found Posted by Alexey @ 14:23 GMT\nWe have received a few submissions of a re-packed Netsky worm variant. It is functionally identical to the Netsky.Z worm, but is additionally packed with ASPack file compressor. We detect this variant as 'W32/Netsky.Z@mm' or as 'Email-Worm.Win32.NetSky.aa'.\nSpammers fight back Posted by Alexey @ 09:37 GMT\nIn an interesting twist, apparently one of the spam sites under attack from Lycos' \"Make Love not Spam\" operation has turned the tables. The front page of a spammer site called www.moretgage.info (which used to sell cheap mortgage loans) has been changed to contain a Meta Refresh tag, redirecting all web traffic to...www.makelovenotspam.com.\nAs an end result, depending on how the Lycos client works, the screen savers downloaded from makelovenotspam.com might be attacking the download site itself.\nIn another development, Lycos made a statement that this site was not defaced two days ago (see our weblog post on November 30th). However, we've received three independent reports from users who saw the defacement and even made screen shots of it...including one report from an editor of a computer magazine.\nUpdate on 4th of December, 2004: Lycos has confirmed to us that their screensaver does not follow Meta Refresh tags, so this attempt by spammers will fail. --Mikko\nImportant note about Microsoft's MS04-040 update Posted by Sami @ 08:38 GMT\nAccording to Microsoft, the MS04-040 update does not include all hotfixes or patches released since February's (MS04-004) or October's (MS04-038) Cumulative Updates for Internet Explorer. So, if you have received fixes via Microsoft or via their support providers, you should use Internet Explorer SP1 update rollup instead.\nLike Ero mentioned earlier, MS04-040 fixes the Internet Explorer vulnerability that is exploited actively. This vulnerability was used, for example, by Bofra worm, so upgrading as soon as possible is highly recommended.\nWednesday, December 1, 2004\nMicrosoft releases critical update for IE Posted by Ero @ 19:41 GMT\nToday Microsoft released a critical update for Internet Explorer.

Paul Roberts, IDG News Service Friday, December 03, 2004 Lycos Europe is caught in a struggle with spammers, just days after releasing a free screensaver software program that uses computer down time to swamp Web sites associated with spam campaigns. Advertisement At least one Web site targeted by Lycos's \"Make love not spam\" screensaver program, Moretgage.info, has changed its Web page, forwarding requests it receives to Makelovenotespam.com, a Web domain that distributes the screensaver program, according to F-Secure. The escalating war with spammers comes amid mounting criticism of the screen saver from antispam experts and a crackdown by ISPs on the program. Spamming the Spammers Lycos launched the \"Make Love, Not Spam\" screensaver Wednesday, but was circulating a beta version of the software before that. The screensaver promises to \"spam the spammers\" by sending a steady stream of requests to a list of Web sites that have been used in spam campaigns, slowing those sites. The list of sites to attack is downloaded by the screensaver program from a control server operated by Lycos. Charges quickly surfaced that Lycos was crossing the line by launching a DDOS (distributed denial of service) attack, which is illegal in the U.S. and most European countries. The antispam campaign also prompted quick retaliation from unknown parties, including a reported hack of the makelovenotspam.com Web site. Lycos denied that its Web site was hacked and stated that makelovenotspam does not launch denial of service attacks, because the company is careful to avoid completely shutting down the sites it targets. The company did not respond to requests for comment for this story. The Moretgage.info Web page was changed to contain an HTML Meta Refresh tag that forwards all requests to view the page to Makelovenotespam.com, effectively using the screensaver to launch attacks on Lycos's Web site, F-Secure says. Requests for moretgage.info were still being forwarded to Makelovenotspam.com Thursday morning, Eastern Standard Time. Traffic Blocked More troubling for Lycos, some ISPs are blocking traffic to the server that controls the makelovenotspam screensavers, according to Johannes Ullrich, chief technology officer at The SANS Institute's Internet Storm Center. ISPs are treating Lycos's network of machines running the makelovenotspam screensaver in the same way they treat \"botnets\" of compromised systems that are controlled by malicious hackers or organized online criminal groups and often used to distribute spam or launch DOS attacks, he says. \"The [makelovenotspam] application isn't really all that well thought out. In a way, it's doing a DDOS attack, and DDOS attacks are always a bad thing, because there are always innocent bystanders who get hit as well,\" he says. \"I would have to characterize it as an astonishingly stupid idea,\" says John Levine of the Internet Research Task Force's Antispam Research Group. Legal questions aside, the \"spam the spammers\" approach won't work, because those behind spam campaigns can quickly take down and move Web sites referred to in spam e-mail. The makelovenotspam program also consumes bandwidth and resources from the networks and ISPs that serve machines running the software, not just from spammer networks, he says. \"This program steals bandwidth from a lot of people who had no intention of playing junior DDOS cop,\" Levine says. Ullrich and others consider the \"Make Love not Spam\" campaign a publicity stunt, more than a well-planned antispam campaign, but say that it was poorly thought out. \"This is like a lame idea that a college kid would think of, not something a serious company would do,\" Levine says. Resistance from ISPs may bring a quick end to the \"Make Love Not Spam\" campaign, he says. \"My guess is that they won't be able to sustain this very long, once legitimate networks have figured out who is controlling [the machines running the screensaver] and start blocking access to that host,\" he says.\nPrinter Friendly Version", "title": "Lycos, Spammers Trade Blows", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,118816,00.asp", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041208141548/http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,118816,00.asp"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Lycos confirms anti-spam tool axe\nDecember 6, 2004\nClaire Woffenden\nLycos has confirmed that it has scrapped its anti-spam screensaver, which launched last week as a way for people to fight back against junk email.\nThe software, \"Make Love, Not Spam\" was designed to sit on an individual's PC and, when the machine was not being used, generate traffic on the sites of known spammers.\nBut within days of launch, the service came under increasing criticism with experts questioning the legality of attacking spammers' websites in this way.\nSecurity company Sophos advised computer users not to use the screensaver. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos, said: \"Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.\"\nLycos has dismissed claims that the service launched distributed denial of service attacks but has decided to close the site.\nIn a statement today, Lycos said: \u201cThe aim of the campaign was to ignite a debate about anti-spam measures. We feel that we have achieved this through our activity and will now continue that debate with others in the email industry. We hope that this will lead to further new and innovative solutions to the problem of spam.\"\n\"Contrary to some reports, the service never launched a \"distributed denial of service attack\". Rather a centralised database ensured all known spammers' sites were left with at least five per cent of bandwidth. The idea was simply to slow spammers' sites and this was achieved by the campaign.\"\nLycos has also denied reports that the website was hacked last week. It claims a hoax screengrab was circulated. It has also assured users of Make Love, Not Spam that they are not at risk of attack by any spammers and that their IP address could not be logged by any third parties as a result of visiting makelovenotspam.com or downloading the screensaver.\nBack to index", "title": "Lycos confirms anti-spam tool axe", "url": "http://www.webuser.co.uk/news/59969.html", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041212094329/http://www.webuser.co.uk/news/59969.html"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Older News: December of 2004\nFriday, December 17, 2004\nAnother new Atak found Posted by Mikko @ 15:42 GMT\nA new minor variant of the Atak worm was found today (we detect it already).\nThis one also sends fake electronic Christmas cards.\nInterestingly, it also contains a link to an image mocking the Lycos' \"Make Love Not Spam\" site...here the image reads \"Make Love With Spam\":\nThursday, December 16, 2004\nNine year sentence for wardriving in USA Posted by Mikko @ 07:26 GMT\nA 21-year old hacker has been sentenced to jail in Michigan for hacking via wardriving.\nWardriving is a technique in which you drive around with a car which has an antenna to search for vulnerable WLAN access points.

One is that some internet operators are not allowing traffic from their IP range to this website - instead, they are referring it to a site with this 'educational' message.\nThe other choice is DNS poisoning. DNS poisoning is an attack where a malicious attacker floods a domain name server with DNS requests and fake responses to them. The target is to convince a specific DNS server that domain FOO.BAR should point to 1.2.3.4 when it really should point to 9.8.7.6, or so. However, such an attack isn't global - only users behind a specific DNS server would access the wrong site. But for those users it would be nearly impossibly to notice.\nThis vulnerability has been known for ages. It used to be fairly easy to do, but then random number generators used by BIND and other DNS tools got improved, making it much harder.\nHowever, it is still doable. For more details, read a good paper on the subject, written by Joe Stewart (of LURHQ fame).\nThursday, December 2, 2004\nA re-packed Netsky variant found Posted by Alexey @ 14:23 GMT\nWe have received a few submissions of a re-packed Netsky worm variant. It is functionally identical to the Netsky.Z worm, but is additionally packed with ASPack file compressor. We detect this variant as 'W32/Netsky.Z@mm' or as 'Email-Worm.Win32.NetSky.aa'.\nSpammers fight back Posted by Alexey @ 09:37 GMT\nIn an interesting twist, apparently one of the spam sites under attack from Lycos' \"Make Love not Spam\" operation has turned the tables. The front page of a spammer site called www.moretgage.info (which used to sell cheap mortgage loans) has been changed to contain a Meta Refresh tag, redirecting all web traffic to...www.makelovenotspam.com.\nAs an end result, depending on how the Lycos client works, the screen savers downloaded from makelovenotspam.com might be attacking the download site itself.\nIn another development, Lycos made a statement that this site was not defaced two days ago (see our weblog post on November 30th). However, we've received three independent reports from users who saw the defacement and even made screen shots of it...including one report from an editor of a computer magazine.\nUpdate on 4th of December, 2004: Lycos has confirmed to us that their screensaver does not follow Meta Refresh tags, so this attempt by spammers will fail. --Mikko\nImportant note about Microsoft's MS04-040 update Posted by Sami @ 08:38 GMT\nAccording to Microsoft, the MS04-040 update does not include all hotfixes or patches released since February's (MS04-004) or October's (MS04-038) Cumulative Updates for Internet Explorer. So, if you have received fixes via Microsoft or via their support providers, you should use Internet Explorer SP1 update rollup instead.\nLike Ero mentioned earlier, MS04-040 fixes the Internet Explorer vulnerability that is exploited actively. This vulnerability was used, for example, by Bofra worm, so upgrading as soon as possible is highly recommended.\nWednesday, December 1, 2004\nMicrosoft releases critical update for IE Posted by Ero @ 19:41 GMT\nToday Microsoft released a critical update for Internet Explorer. Affected systems are Windows NT, 2000 and Windows XP.\nWindows XP SP2 and the 64 bit version are not affected.\nMore detailed information can be found in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-040\nThis update fixes a bug that allows remote code execution. This bug has been exploited by several malware lately.\nFeature story on Sasser incident Posted by Mikko @ 11:03 GMT\nPC World published this last month but we just noticed the article now: there's a pretty good feature story on case Sasser in the November issue.\nThis article, written by a former intelligence officer Dan Verton, goes all the way to explain how exactly the LSASS hole was found, what Microsoft was doing to patch it and how the exploit code which ended up to the Sasser worm was generated.\nThere's also a nice timeline in the article.", "title": "F-Secure : News from the Lab", "url": "http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-122004.html#00000382", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041218040835/http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-122004.html#00000382"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Even in the fleeting and transitory world of technology, Lycos' spam-busting screensaver was the most short-lived of initiatives. Launched to a fanfare of mixed reaction last week, it has now closed. The plan was to unite users against spam and use the power of their idle machines to attack spammers' websites. The company today issued a statement: \"With this campaign we intended to raise a new impulse in the anti-spam discussion and therefore create awareness for the big economic and societal problems caused by spam. The campaign has reached its goal and thus will be stopped.\" So it was all just a publicity stunt then, an attempt to get us thinking? It seems an unconvincing argument. Thinking along those lines the cynical could draw the logical conclusion that the only beneficiary of all this publicity was Lycos. Other cynics may suggest the company has now walked away from a war it soon realised it was ill-equipped to wage. It would be more convincing if the company was to say 'it seemed like a good idea at the time'. And to many it did. Nearly 100,000 people signed up for the screensaver, showing a huge support for extreme action against spammers - or at least a return to the good, old-fashioned, values of the angry mob. But even those supporters, such as Steve Linford at SpamHaus, who has done more to raise the profile of spam and more to combat those who send it than most, said coming down to the level of the spammer was never going to be the right tactic. \"You can't break into a thief's house just because he breaks into yours,\" said Linford. A case of 'back to the drawing board' for Lycos, then. But sadly the damage may already be done and the long term repercussions could be felt for some time yet by all of us. The problem with such hastily launched initiatives - both online and offline - is the message they send out when they fail. Each storm the spammers ride out will convince them further that they are untouchable - a Teflon tech menace. Each encouragement of this kind will likely see them raise their game.

Lula continued to pursue this objective when he took over the presidency in January 2003.\nThe South American community will constitute an enormous market, encompassing 17 million square kilometres in territory and 350 million consumers, with a combined gross domestic product of 1.2 trillion dollars and 190 billion dollars in annual exports.\nThe region is home to enough oil, gas and mineral reserves to supply its industries for over a century, as well as eight million square kilometres of forests and 27 percent of the world's freshwater reserves.\nIt links the planet's two largest oceans, the Pacific and Atlantic, and could become a world leader in biodiversity and food production.\n\"Nevertheless, and despite the underlying economic interest, what has been most decisive in this regional process is political will, which is what must take precedence,\" said Roberto Guarnieri of Venezuela, the permanent secretary of the Caracas-based Latin American Economic System (SELA), made up of 25 Latin American and Caribbean states.\nGuarnieri told IPS that the bloc being created this week in Peru \"will need a body responsible for developing programmes and proposals and monitoring progress from a technical and administrative point of view, like the executive commission of the European Union, and we have proposed that SELA serve as its basis.\"\nThe Brazilian government and former Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde (2002-2003), the president of the Mercosur Commission of Permanent Representatives and a fervent promoter of the South American project, initially proposed the establishment of a separate structure for the South American community, but the idea has gradually lost steam at the preparatory meetings.\nIn any event, some sort of follow-up mechanism will be needed to monitor the implementation of the initiatives adopted in Cusco, particularly with regard to the proposed infrastructure projects.\nWagner noted that there are a total of 350 projects -- encompassing highways, bridges, railways, ports, airports and telecommunications -- aimed at reinforcing the ten integration \"hubs\" established by the Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America (IIRSA).\nA study conducted by the IBRI in 2000 revealed that at least half of these projects directly involve Brazil, and would cost at least 200 billion dollars to carry out.\nNow, 32 of the IIRSA projects have been chosen as one of the first initiatives to be jointly undertaken by the new South American community. The bloc will seek multilateral financing to cover the more than 4.2 billion dollars needed for their execution.\n\"These are anchor projects that will be carried out over five years. They were chosen because they do not serve merely as corridors between countries and zones, but also as a means of promoting development in border regions, which have traditionally been the poorest and most marginalised in our countries,\" said Wagner.\nBrazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim recently stated that the difference between North America and South America is largely the result of infrastructure.\n\"North America has been an integrated continent since the 19th century. We have only recently begun this process ourselves. The Atlantic-Pacific gap, which doesn't exist in North America, is dramatic in South America, because of the need to cross the Andes or the Amazon,\" he explained.\nThe most energetic promoters of the South American community have been Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela. In fact, leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has called for everything from integrating the region's oil industries to creating a South Atlantic military alliance.\nLess enthusiastic support has come from Chile, Colombia and Uruguay, although the latter should become more strongly inclined towards regional integration when leftist president-elect Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez takes over from conservative President Jorge Batlle in March.\nIn the meantime, Colombia has acted as a political and trade ally of Washington in the region, while Chile has been cautious.\n\"We would like nothing better than to move towards South American integration, but the worst thing we could do would be to ask a child, who has just learned to walk, to run a marathon,\" said Osvaldo Rosales, director of international economic relations at the Chilean Foreign Ministry.\nAnother concern raised has been whether the creation of a South American economic and political union will overshadow relations with the rest of Latin America.\nWagner, for one, does not believe there is any basis for this fear.\n\"Mexico and the Central American countries are in the process of becoming associate members of Mercosur,\" he noted, adding that the last Andean Community presidential summit in July called for a similar association with Mexico and Central America.\n\"Just as Mexico decided to join the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada, as a means of meeting its needs, there is no reason to think that the promotion of a South American union will mean turning our backs on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean,\" said Wagner.\nIn his opinion, \"we are reviving the idea of an integrated Latin America, after this objective became fragmented into various regional processes 30 years ago. Now we are going back to that original vision, through the convergence of subregional structures and within the context of globalisation.\" (END)\nSOUTH AMERICA : Chile Seeks Integration through Energy and Roads\nSend your comments to the editor", "title": "and 32 Small Ones", "url": "http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=26583", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041216202509/http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=26583"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "advertisement\nSouth America Eyes EU-Style Integration\nCUZCO, Peru (Reuters) - South American leaders on Wednesday launched a regional integration pact they said would go beyond rhetoric and usher in European-style unity, but only half the future bloc's 12 presidents turned up to sign it.\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose country is the region's economic powerhouse, vowed integration would go beyond rhetoric and translate into concrete gains, like a $700 million highway linking the Atlantic and Pacific that Brazil and Peru plan to build.\n\"If in the past, geography divided us, today it unites us,\" he said. \"What we have done today is no small thing.\"\nThe leaders of Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay and Uruguay had already stayed away from the summit in Peru's ancient Inca capital, Cuzco, for domestic political and personal reasons.\nBut the Colombian and Bolivian presidents, who did attend, skipped the signing ceremony.

The mechanics of the new entity should come out of another meeting in March or April, he said. \"South America is divided between two big blocs, Mercosur and the Andean Community (made up of Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia and Venezuela),\" Duhalde said. \"Twenty or 30 years ago we were already saying that we had to set the stage for a South American Union, but it was impossible to do it without free trade agreements between South American countries.\" Now, with creation of the South American Community, the Mercosur and Andean Community member countries will team up in negotiations with Washington and the EU to reduce agricultural subsidies, take up joint positions in international organizations and eventually achieve full economic integration, he said. Despite lingering internal problems, such as a territorial dispute between Chile and Bolivia that keeps them from even having diplomatic relations, the two-page draft to be signed by the sub-region's 10 presidents Dec. 9 says participating countries \"conceive the South American Community of Nations as a permanent mechanism of political coordination and cultural, economic, social and physical integration.\" But aren't South American countries doing the opposite of what Europe did when it started with basic economic agreements before venturing into political ones, I asked. The highly successful (now) 25-country EU was born in 1952 as a European Coal and Steel Community in which six countries pooled their coal and steel resources in a common market. Mercosur has not been able to sign a free trade deal with Chile or Peru because its external tariffs are much higher than those of either. Duhalde conceded that many experts say an economic agreement should come first. \"But we have decided to choose the opposite path, because it is very difficult to solve the issue of lowering external tariffs and become one single (free trade) region,\" he said. Wouldn't it make more sense for South American countries to seek free trade agreements with the United States, Europe or Asia, which have much bigger markets for their exports? Southern European countries prospered, in part, because they gained easier export access to their richer European neighbors. \"If you are telling me that farther south of North America there is no Germany or France, that's true,\" Duhalde said. \"But that doesn't mean we shouldn't organize ourselves. ... This is not done against the United States, or against the European Union. This is done to have greater strength, because it is one thing to be sitting alone, individually, and another very different thing to represent the biggest integrated geographic area of the world, of about 17 million square kilometers.\" My conclusion: The soon-to-be-launched South American Community may be putting the cart before the horse by starting as a political rather than economic, union. But if their declaration serves as a stepping stone for economic agreements among themselves and with the world's richest countries, it's a good idea. Yes, it sounds like a pipe dream. But then, the European Union was created by countries that had just been at war with one another, and its initial statements sounded equally \u2013 if not more \u2013 grandiose. Yet, it worked.

The first was held in 2000, on the initiative of Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2003).\nThe debates and ceremonies will take place Wednesday and Thursday in Cuzco and the nearby city of Ayacucho, in southern Peru.\nBrazil's left-leaning President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is one of the driving forces behind the creation of the South American community, which will be based on the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and the Andean Community of Nations (CAN) trade blocs, along with Chile, Guyana and Suriname.\nChile has been an associate member since 1996 of Mercosur, the bloc created in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. It also formed part of the Andean Pact, CAN's predecessor, which it helped create in 1969. But it withdrew from that grouping in 1975, during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990).\nCAN is made up of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. Bolivia and Peru are also associate members of Mercosur, and Venezuela is about to gain that status.\nMercosur is also negotiating association agreements with Mexico and the Central American Common Market.\n\"The project for the creation of a South American community of nations is a contribution to the goals of integration that these countries have long cherished,\" said the Chilean analyst. \"But this involves putting them into practice in a very realistic manner, and above all, with concrete projects.\"\nThe South American community will begin to be built by means of 32 physical infrastructure projects, with a total combined investment of 4.2 billion dollars, over the next five years. The aim is to provide connections throughout a territory covering 17 million square kilometres that is home to more than 350 million people.\nReyes Matta, who helped draft the Andean Pact in the early 1970s, said the proposal for expanding the region's network of roads goes far beyond what has often been empty rhetoric on the need for integration.\n\"There is also the important and novel question of energy integration, which will be a key issue in the 21st century,\" said the analyst. \"In this case, that means assessing the resources -- wind, hydroelectric, natural gas, etc. -- that each country has, in order to transfer energy from one country to another.\"\nAlthough Chile has abundant hydropower resources, it lacks oil and natural gas. Forty percent of the country's energy needs are currently covered by gas imports from Argentina, which were reduced in late 2003, when domestic demand for energy grew in that country.\nPhysical integration with neighbouring countries through new networks of roads will also help boost Chile's exports.\nChile, with its Pacific Ocean ports, also hopes to become a gateway for imports and exports of products between the Southern Cone nations of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific rim region.\nThat objective was underlined by Lagos at the Nov. 21 summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum leaders, which was hosted by Santiago. (The only Latin American members of APEC are Chile, Mexico and Peru).\nHugo Fazio, the director of the leftist National Centre for Alternative Development (CENDA), told IPS that until now Chile has played a \"pernicious\" role in Latin American integration, because it has favoured relations with the United States and APEC at the expense of its ties to Mercosur and CAN.\n\"In the early 1990s, Chile had the opportunity to join Mercosur, but it did not do so, and instead favoured the push for a free trade treaty with the United States. That was under the administration of Patricio Aylwin (1990-1994), but it has also been the focus taken by all of the governments of the Coalition for Democracy,\" he added.\nThe centre-left Coalition has governed the country since the restoration of democracy in 1990.\nFazio, who was vice-president of the Central Bank in the 1970-1973 administration of Salvador Allende (the socialist president who was overthrown by Pinochet), said \"the Chilean government wants to play a really difficult game - maintaining strong political relations with the countries in the region, while from an economic point of view putting higher priority on other situations.\"\n\"But the link between the economy and politics is very direct,\" said the director of CENDA.\nFavouring relations with the Asia-Pacific rim region at the expense of ties with the rest of Latin America \"is criticizable in every sense,\" said Reyes Matta.\nThe former ambassador underlined that Lagos himself, in articles published in newspapers in Brazil and Argentina on the occasion of the APEC summit, said Chile has a key role to play in terms of interaction between the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of South America.\nReyes Matta also pointed to the specific characteristics of the Chilean economy.\n\"It is necessary to understand that unlike countries like Brazil and Argentina, Chile's gross domestic product (GDP) depends on foreign trade. It's not that an overly heavy accent is put (on the Asia-Pacific region), but that we have put the minimum accent needed to carry out a coherent 'economic project',\" said the analyst.\nAnd one that has been successful, he added, since Chile is considered the most competitive country in Latin America, and because it has helped bolster the development and growth of the Chilean economy, 70 percent of whose GDP depends on exports and imports.\n\"There is an enormous difference, for example, with Brazil, where exports and imports make up 22 or 23 percent of GDP,\" said Reyes Matta.\n\"Chile has no choice but to stake its bets on insertion in the world, but it does so from where it is, and for that reason, it is a factor of interaction between the markets of South America and other markets,\" said Reyes Matta.\nSenator Sergio Romero of the right-wing National Renovation Party said Chile's participation in the South American community will be effective if there are clearly defined accords on the scope and details of the initiative. But, he pointed out to IPS, \"South American public opinion\" is not familiar with the project.

Peace on earth depends on our ability to secure our living environment. Maathai stands at the front of the fight to promote ecologically viable social, economic and cultural development in Kenya and in Africa. She has taken a holistic approach to sustainable development that embraces democracy, human rights and women's rights in particular. She thinks globally and acts locally. Maathai stood up courageously against the former oppressive regime in Kenya. Her unique forms of action have contributed to drawing attention to political oppression - nationally and internationally. She has served as inspiration for many in the fight for democratic rights and has especially encouraged women to better their situation. Maathai combines science, social commitment and active politics. More than simply protecting the existing environment, her strategy is to secure and strengthen the very basis for ecologically sustainable development. She founded the Green Belt Movement where, for nearly thirty years, she has mobilized poor women to plant 30 million trees. Her methods have been adopted by other countries as well. We are all witness to how deforestation and forest loss have led to desertification in Africa and threatened many other regions of the world - in Europe too. Protecting forests against desertification is a vital factor in the struggle to strengthen the living environment of our common Earth. Through education, family planning, nutrition and the fight against corruption, the Green Belt Movement has paved the way for development at grass-root level. We believe that Maathai is a strong voice speaking for the best forces in Africa to promote peace and good living conditions on that continent. Wangari Maathai will be the first woman from Africa to be honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize. She will also be the first African from the vast area between South Africa and Egypt to be awarded the prize.

As the first African woman to receive this prize, I accept it on behalf of the people of Kenya and Africa, and indeed the world. I am especially mindful of women and the girl child. I hope it will encourage them to raise their voices and take more space for leadership. I know the honour also gives a deep sense of pride to our men, both old and young. As a mother, I appreciate the inspiration this brings to the youth and urge them to use it to pursue their dreams. Although this prize comes to me, it acknowledges the work of countless individuals and groups across the globe. They work quietly and often without recognition to protect the environment, promote democracy, defend human rights and ensure equality between women and men. By so doing, they plant seeds of peace. I know they, too, are proud today. To all who feel represented by this prize I say use it to advance your mission and meet the high expectations the world will place on us. This honour is also for my family, friends, partners and supporters throughout the world. All of them helped shape the vision and sustain our work, which was often accomplished under hostile conditions. I am also grateful to the people of Kenya - who remained stubbornly hopeful that democracy could be realized and their environment managed sustainably. Because of this support, I am here today to accept this great honour. I am immensely privileged to join my fellow African Peace laureates, Presidents Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the late Chief Albert Luthuli, the late Anwar el-Sadat and the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan. I know that African people everywhere are encouraged by this news. My fellow Africans, as we embrace this recognition, let us use it to intensify our commitment to our people, to reduce conflicts and poverty and thereby improve their quality of life. Let us embrace democratic governance, protect human rights and protect our environment. I am confident that we shall rise to the occasion. I have always believed that solutions to most of our problems must come from us. In this year\u2019s prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has placed the critical issue of environment and its linkage to democracy and peace before the world. For their visionary action, I am profoundly grateful. Recognizing that sustainable development, democracy and peace are indivisible is an idea whose time has come. Our work over the past 30 years has always appreciated and engaged these linkages. My inspiration partly comes from my childhood experiences and observations of Nature in rural Kenya. It has been influenced and nurtured by the formal education I was privileged to receive in Kenya, the United States and Germany. As I was growing up, I witnessed forests being cleared and replaced by commercial plantations, which destroyed local biodiversity and the capacity of the forests to conserve water. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, In 1977, when we started the Green Belt Movement, I was partly responding to needs identified by rural women, namely lack of firewood, clean drinking water, balanced diets, shelter and income. Throughout Africa, women are the primary caretakers, holding significant responsibility for tilling the land and feeding their families. As a result, they are often the first to become aware of environmental damage as resources become scarce and incapable of sustaining their families. The women we worked with recounted that unlike in the past, they were unable to meet their basic needs. This was due to the degradation of their immediate environment as well as the introduction of commercial farming, which replaced the growing of household food crops. But international trade controlled the price of the exports from these small-scale farmers and a reasonable and just income could not be guaranteed. I came to understand that when the environment is destroyed, plundered or mismanaged, we undermine our quality of life and that of future generations. Tree planting became a natural choice to address some of the initial basic needs identified by women. Also, tree planting is simple, attainable and guarantees quick, successful results within a reasonable amount time. This sustains interest and commitment. So, together, we have planted over 30 million trees that provide fuel, food, shelter, and income to support their children\u2019s education and household needs. The activity also creates employment and improves soils and watersheds. Through their involvement, women gain some degree of power over their lives, especially their social and economic position and relevance in the family. This work continues. Initially, the work was difficult because historically our people have been persuaded to believe that because they are poor, they lack not only capital, but also knowledge and skills to address their challenges. Instead they are conditioned to believe that solutions to their problems must come from \u2018outside\u2019. Further, women did not realize that meeting their needs depended on their environment being healthy and well managed. They were also unaware that a degraded environment leads to a scramble for scarce resources and may culminate in poverty and even conflict. They were also unaware of the injustices of international economic arrangements. In order to assist communities to understand these linkages, we developed a citizen education program, during which people identify their problems, the causes and possible solutions. They then make connections between their own personal actions and the problems they witness in the environment and in society. They learn that our world is confronted with a litany of woes: corruption, violence against women and children, disruption and breakdown of families, and disintegration of cultures and communities. They also identify the abuse of drugs and chemical substances, especially among young people. There are also devastating diseases that are defying cures or occurring in epidemic proportions. Of particular concern are HIV/AIDS, malaria and diseases associated with malnutrition. On the environment front, they are exposed to many human activities that are devastating to the environment and societies. These include widespread destruction of ecosystems, especially through deforestation, climatic instability, and contamination in the soils and waters that all contribute to excruciating poverty. In the process, the participants discover that they must be part of the solutions. They realize their hidden potential and are empowered to overcome inertia and take action. They come to recognize that they are the primary custodians and beneficiaries of the environment that sustains them. Entire communities also come to understand that while it is necessary to hold their governments accountable, it is equally important that in their own relationships with each other, they exemplify the leadership values they wish to see in their own leaders, namely justice, integrity and trust. Although initially the Green Belt Movement\u2019s tree planting activities did not address issues of democracy and peace, it soon became clear that responsible governance of the environment was impossible without democratic space. Therefore, the tree became a symbol for the democratic struggle in Kenya. Citizens were mobilised to challenge widespread abuses of power, corruption and environmental mismanagement. In Nairobi \u2019s Uhuru Park, at Freedom Corner, and in many parts of the country, trees of peace were planted to demand the release of prisoners of conscience and a peaceful transition to democracy. Through the Green Belt Movement, thousands of ordinary citizens were mobilized and empowered to take action and effect change. They learned to overcome fear and a sense of helplessness and moved to defend democratic rights. In time, the tree also became a symbol for peace and conflict resolution, especially during ethnic conflicts in Kenya when the Green Belt Movement used peace trees to reconcile disputing communities. During the ongoing re-writing of the Kenyan constitution, similar trees of peace were planted in many parts of the country to promote a culture of peace. Using trees as a symbol of peace is in keeping with a widespread African tradition. For example, the elders of the Kikuyu carried a staff from the thigi tree that, when placed between two disputing sides, caused them to stop fighting and seek reconciliation. Many communities in Africa have these traditions. Such practises are part of an extensive cultural heritage, which contributes both to the conservation of habitats and to cultures of peace. With the destruction of these cultures and the introduction of new values, local biodiversity is no longer valued or protected and as a result, it is quickly degraded and disappears. For this reason, The Green Belt Movement explores the concept of cultural biodiversity, especially with respect to indigenous seeds and medicinal plants. As we progressively understood the causes of environmental degradation, we saw the need for good governance. Indeed, the state of any county\u2019s environment is a reflection of the kind of governance in place, and without good governance there can be no peace. Many countries, which have poor governance systems, are also likely to have conflicts and poor laws protecting the environment. In 2002, the courage, resilience, patience and commitment of members of the Green Belt Movement, other civil society organizations, and the Kenyan public culminated in the peaceful transition to a democratic government and laid the foundation for a more stable society. Excellencies, friends, ladies and gentlemen, It is 30 years since we started this work. Activities that devastate the environment and societies continue unabated. Today we are faced with a challenge that calls for a shift in our thinking, so that humanity stops threatening its life-support system. We are called to assist the Earth to heal her wounds and in the process heal our own \u2013 indeed, to embrace the whole creation in all its diversity, beauty and wonder. This will happen if we see the need to revive our sense of belonging to a larger family of life, with which we have shared our evolutionary process. In the course of history, there comes a time when humanity is called to shift to a new level of consciousness, to reach a higher moral ground. A time when we have to shed our fear and give hope to each other. That time is now. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has challenged the world to broaden the understanding of peace: there can be no peace without equitable development; and there can be no development without sustainable management of the environment in a democratic and peaceful space. This shift is an idea whose time has come. I call on leaders, especially from Africa, to expand democratic space and build fair and just societies that allow the creativity and energy of their citizens to flourish. Those of us who have been privileged to receive education, skills, and experiences and even power must be role models for the next generation of leadership. In this regard, I would also like to appeal for the freedom of my fellow laureate Aung San Suu Kyi so that she can continue her work for peace and democracy for the people of Burma and the world at large. Culture plays a central role in the political, economic and social life of communities. Indeed, culture may be the missing link in the development of Africa. Culture is dynamic and evolves over time, consciously discarding retrogressive traditions, like female genital mutilation (FGM), and embracing aspects that are good and useful. Africans, especially, should re-discover positive aspects of their culture. In accepting them, they would give themselves a sense of belonging, identity and self-confidence. Ladies and Gentlemen, There is also need to galvanize civil society and grassroots movements to catalyse change. I call upon governments to recognize the role of these social movements in building a critical mass of responsible citizens, who help maintain checks and balances in society. On their part, civil society should embrace not only their rights but also their responsibilities. Further, industry and global institutions must appreciate that ensuring economic justice, equity and ecological integrity are of greater value than profits at any cost. The extreme global inequities and prevailing consumption patterns continue at the expense of the environment and peaceful co-existence. The choice is ours. I would like to call on young people to commit themselves to activities that contribute toward achieving their long-term dreams. They have the energy and creativity to shape a sustainable future. To the young people I say, you are a gift to your communities and indeed the world. You are our hope and our future. The holistic approach to development, as exemplified by the Green Belt Movement, could be embraced and replicated in more parts of Africa and beyond. It is for this reason that I have established the Wangari Maathai Foundation to ensure the continuation and expansion of these activities. Although a lot has been achieved, much remains to be done. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, As I conclude I reflect on my childhood experience when I would visit a stream next to our home to fetch water for my mother. I would drink water straight from the stream. Playing among the arrowroot leaves I tried in vain to pick up the strands of frogs\u2019 eggs, believing they were beads. But every time I put my little fingers under them they would break. Later, I saw thousands of tadpoles: black, energetic and wriggling through the clear water against the background of the brown earth. This is the world I inherited from my parents. Today, over 50 years later, the stream has dried up, women walk long distances for water, which is not always clean, and children will never know what they have lost. The challenge is to restore the home of the tadpoles and give back to our children a world of beauty and wonder. Thank you very much.", "title": "Wangari Maathai", "url": "http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/2004/maathai-lecture.html", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041212190711/http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/2004/maathai-lecture.html"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Nobel of the Ball Kenyan eco-activist Wangari Maathai wins Nobel Peace Prize By Geoffrey Dabelko Wangari Maathai with good reason to smile.

And it's made even smaller by the impressive portraits of past winners lining the walls, listening in on the secret deliberations of the Nobel Peace Prize committee.Amidst the daily drumbeat of war stories, the committee hatched a wonderful surprise in that small third-story room.

Maathai will now receive the wide recognition she deserves for fighting to protect Kenya's forests from corruption and degradation.In 1977, Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement , which planted 30 million trees across the country, in the process employing thousands of women and offering them empowerment, education, and even family planning.GBM was grounded in the firm belief that environmental protection is inextricably linked to improving human living conditions. As Maathai told the UNESCO Courier in 1999, \"If you want to save the environment, you should protect the people first, because human beings are part of biological diversity. And if we can't protect our own species, what's the point of protecting tree species?\"This grassroots movement had a broader impact than more traditional \"environmental\" movements.

{"title": "Jury suggests the death penalty for Scott Peterson", "text": ["{{date|December 13, 2004}}", "Redwood City, California - The jury in the Scott Peterson trial suggest that Peterson receive the death penalty. Peterson was found guilty of murdering his pregnant wife Laci and their unborn child.", "The official sentence will be announced on February 25th, 2005.", "{publish}}\n{{archive}}"], "categories": ["United States", "Crime and law", "Death penalty"], "sources": [{"language": "en", "maintext": "Scott Peterson should die in San Quentin's death chamber for murdering his wife, Laci, and their unborn child, a jury said today.\nThe six-woman, six-man panel took about 11 hours to reach their decision. Their verdict capped six months of testimony in one of the most highly publicized trials in recent history - and as word of it was relayed to the hundreds of people gathered outside the courthouse, many broke into cheers.\nInside the courtroom, Peterson stood stone-faced as he heard his fate. There was hardly a sound in the courtroom.\nThe case first captured the nation's attention when Laci Peterson disappeared from her Modesto home the day before Christmas 2002 and has engrossed the country ever since.\nIn January, a Modesto judge determined that the Modesto fertilizer salesman couldn't get a fair trial in his hometown because of all the publicity and moved the case to San Mateo County, which has not seen a death verdict in 10 years.\nThe jurors -- many who said they could only impose a death sentence in the most egregious of cases and one who went as far as to consult with his priest early on in the selection process -- spent the morning deliberating, and then announced at 11:30 a.m. they had reached their decision.\nNot long after that, Peterson was brought into the courtroom and sat chatting with his attorney, Mark Geragos, occasionally smiling. Shortly before the jury re-entered, Peterson turned and gave a tight grin to his family.\nAs they entered the courtroom, the jurors betrayed no emotion. Only one glanced at Peterson; the rest avoided his gaze. They quickly took their seats, then sat silently while court clerk Marylin Morton read the sentence at 1:49 p.m.\nThe jury, Morton said, had unanimously voted to \"fix the penalty at death.\"\nUnlike on Nov. 12, when sobs filled the air as Peterson was found guilty of murdering his wife and their unborn child, there was an almost surreal stillness in the courtroom while the death recommendation was announced. There was little reaction, visual or audible, from either the families of Laci Peterson or the man convicted of killing her -- and the only immediate reaction on the jury was from juror No. 9, who teared up.\nAs the jury filed from the room, three jurors nodded to Sharon Rocha, Laci Peterson's mother. Juror No. 4 -- a former police officer -- winked at her.\nOutside the courthouse, hundreds of people remained roped off from the entrance steps by yellow police tape. With televisions and radios tuned to hear an audio feed of the verdict, some cheered as the death recommendation was read. Others simply looked sad.\nGeragos offered little reaction in a quick statement to the press. \"Obviously we're very disappointed,\" he said, vowing to appeal the verdict. \"It's a very difficult time.\" He asked the press to respect the privacy of Peterson's family members, and said they would make a statement sometime in the next week.\nAn hour after the reading of the verdicts, three jurors took media questions, looking a bit shell-shocked. They said there was no one thing that had made them rule guilty in November, and that the horror of the crimes and the apparently callous way Peterson carried them out made the death sentence inevitable.\n\"Scott Peterson was Laci's husband, Conner's (the unborn child) daddy,\" said juror Richelle Nice, an unemployed mother of four who lives in East Palo Alto. \"Someone should have protected him (the child). And for him to have done that ...\" Her voice broke and she sat quiet, unable to finish her sentence.\nJury foreman Stephen Cardosi, a paramedic who lives in Half Moon Bay, explained that he found the evidence leading to a guilty verdict was overwhelming.\n\"It's hard to narrow it down to one specific issue or topic,\" he said. \"Collaboratively, when you add it all up, there doesn't appear to be any other possibility.\"\nJudge Alfred Delucchi, who is presiding over the case, scheduled Peterson's official sentencing hearing on Feb. 25. At that time, Delucchi will have the discretion to reject the jury's verdict of capital punishment in favor of the lesser sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. California judges have rarely ruled to override a jury's decision to execute a convicted killer.\nIf Delucchi adopts the jury's choice, Peterson, 32, will join as many as 644 inmates on death row. His case will automatically be appealed to the California Supreme Court. Lengthy appeals in federal court may follow, and it could be 20 years before Peterson runs out of appeals and is put to death. Since the death penalty was reinstated in California in 1977, 10 people have been executed.\nThe announcement today that a verdict had been reached came shortly after jurors had asked to see a number of photographs. They included autopsy pictures of the remains of Laci Peterson and her unborn son and a photo of the very pregnant Laci taken shortly before she disappeared.\nThe jury requested the photos and several other pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution team during the five-month-long trial phase of the trial. They also asked for just one piece of evidence submitted by the defense.\nThe gruesome autopsy photographs have been sealed from the public as has most of the other evidence requested by the jurors today. The jury also asked for aerial shots of San Francisco Bay, the site where Peterson said he'd been fishing on the day his wife disappeared and the location where Laci Peterson and the couple's baby washed ashore four months later.\nThe jury also asked to see a picture Laci Peterson that prosecutor Rick Distaso called the \"most telling pictures in all the trial.\"\nThe photo of the eight-months-pregnant woman, dressed in a red pantsuit, was taken about a week before she disappeared at a Christmas party she attended alone. During the trial, the jury heard that on the night the photograph was taken, the defendant was in Fresno attending another Christmas party with his secret girlfriend, Amber Frey.\n\"This is probably one of the most telling pictures in all of all the trial -- Laci sitting alone at that Christmas party, by herself, teetering in on those big high heels, even though her feet are swollen with an advanced state of pregnancy, with a smile on her face, making the best of it,'' Distaso said during his closing argument in November.\nPeterson was convicted Nov. 12 of first-degree murder for the death of Laci Peterson and second-degree murder for the death of their unborn son just before Christmas 2002. During the eight-day penalty phase, prosecutors argued that Peterson should be put to death. They called four of Laci Peterson's family members to the stand to commemorate her life. Their last witness was the victim's mother, Sharon Rocha.\nIn an emotional tirade from the stand, Rocha confronted her son-in-law, yelling at him for murdering her daughter.\nStanislaus County Deputy District Attorney Dave Harris told the jury that Peterson began plotting his diabolical scheme to kill his eight-months-pregnant wife and dump her body in San Francisco Bay exactly two years ago.\n\"Scott Peterson is the worst of the worst because he's the kind of person that no one ever sees coming,\" he told the jury during closing arguments Thursday. Harris told jurors to remember the 116 days of grief, anguish and torment Peterson caused his and Laci's families while they searched for the missing 27-year-old woman.\n\"Life (in prison) is not appropriate,\" argued Harris, who said Peterson is nothing but a murderous con man. \"I want you to think about his cruel lack of compassion. He left his wife's body to rot in the bottom of the ocean. He left his son to be found as trash. Someone who shows no mercy, who is so heartless deserves death.\"\nThe defense called 39 witnesses, including Peterson's mother, to testify on her son's behalf. Jackie Peterson pleaded with the jury to spare Peterson's life, saying that although he'd be confined to prison for the rest of his life he could still contribute to society.\n\"I believe Scott Peterson has the ability to affect other lives,\" defense lawyer Pat Harris told the jury during his summations. \"I'm asking you to look at what people have testified to. This is a man who continually helped people.\"The witnesses, people from all aspects and eras of Peterson's life, talked about his good qualities, his charitable deeds and gave endearing anecdotes about his life.\nGeragos begged the jury to stop the \"cycle\" of killing and spare his client's life.\n\"There is nothing that putting him to death is going to do. It's not going to bring back Laci and their grandson,\" he said.\nThe same jury that recommended Peterson's penalty found him guilty of the first-degree murder of his wife and the second-degree murder of his unborn child. The panel also found Peterson guilty of the special circumstance of multiple murders, making him eligible under California law for the death penalty.\nNews of the Nov. 12 verdict spread faster than a drought-year brush fire. Hundreds of people crowded outside the courthouse to cheer the jurors and jeer the Peterson family as they left the building. The judge later remarked that he had never seen anything like it in his long career as a judge and lawyer.\nThe defense demanded that the case be moved out of the county and requested that a new jury decide the penalty phase. But Delucchi denied the appeal, saying there is no place left in the universe where people haven't heard about the case. His decision was upheld by the California Supreme Court.\nProsecutors, including in the Peterson case, have sought the death penalty five times in San Mateo County in the last decade, according to officials. Four of those murder cases were local and in every case the jury spared the life of the defendant.\nChronicle staff writer Bob Egelko contributed this report. / E-mail the writers at sfinz@sfchronicle.com, dwalsh@sfchronicle.com and kfagan@sfchronicle.com.", "title": "Jury recommends death for Scott Peterson", "url": "http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/12/13/PETERSON13.DTL", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041223035312/http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/12/13/PETERSON13.DTL"}]}

Keith Kameg said. \"When an officer went to check on (Lady) she was cowering in the back of her crate as if the officer was going to hurt her.\"\nLady had a bloody left front paw from being bit by Lacy, police reported.\nThe revelation that Lacy bit the small dog as punishment came after a showdown with officers in which Lacy allegedly used another of his dogs -- a bull mastiff estimated by police to weigh 200 pounds -- to try to keep officers out of his apartment.\nKameg said Lacy's actions with the mastiff, named Breaker, put officers in a position where they might have needed to shoot Breaker.\nThe incident happened Saturday afternoon at the apartment of Lacy and his girlfriend, Julia Lynn Bertrand, 19, according to a police report.\nBertrand's mother called police because she was concerned about an argument between Bertrand and Lacy over him biting Lady.\nSeveral officers went to the apartment and could hear arguing inside and a dog barking. The report said that Lacy refused to let them in. Officers then kicked in the door.\n\"Lacy was standing approximately six feet inside with the the bull mastiff on leash,\" Officer Tracy Plank wrote. \"The dog's leash was taut and the dog was lunging toward Officer (Al) Moore. Both Officer Moore and I drew our firearms in case the dog got loose.\"\nThe report stated that Lacy tried to get into the bathroom with the mastiff but was stopped by the officers. He eventually was handcuffed and taken to jail on one count each of felony animal cruelty and resisting arrest without violence. He remained jailed Monday with bail set at $25,000.\nSeveral dog trainers and animal behavior experts said they have never heard of training or punishing a dog by biting it. They added that it would not be an effective way to train a dog, and that it is a form of cruelty.\nPepe Peruyero is a former police officer who now operates J&K; Canine Academy. Peruyero said he has heard of training methods such as growling or holding a dog down in a dominant way, but he discounts even these techniques.\nPeruyero said disciplining a dog by hitting or inflicting pain in some way may condition the dog to bite in a reactive way.\n\"If you are inflicting injury or breaking skin, or the dog is responding to pain, you are not doing any good,\" Peruyero said. \"A lot of people will spank their dogs on the butt or on the nose. Then, when they are at the park and somebody goes to pet the dog on the butt or touch the face, the dog may think it is going to get struck and will lash out by biting.\"\nCindy Swirko writes for The Gainesville Sun.\nSave more than $150 with coupons in\nSunday's Ledger.

The two clubs have been among the form sides in Europe this season and the tie will see Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho against one of his former clubs. The first leg will be held at Barcelona's Nou Camp on Feb 22 or 23 with the return at Stamford Bridge a fortnight later. Premiership champions Arsenal have been paired with 2001 winners Bayern Munich and will play their first leg away. Manchester United and Liverpool, who will both play at home first, have been paired with AC Milan and Bayer Leverkusen respectively. Mourinho, who worked as an assistant coach with the club before moving into management and eventually going on to win the Champions League with Porto last year, yesterday said that he wanted to play Barcelona in the last 16. \"For emotional reasons and because everyone says they are the best in Europe at the moment, I would like to play Barcelona,\" he said. \"In football, top people are never scared. We always want to play against the big teams, the big managers, players always want to play big players. We always want these things for our careers.\" Arsenal last came up against Bayern in the group stages of the Germans' successful 2000-01 campaign, drawing at Highbury but losing at the Olympic Stadium. United are also coming up against opposition they have met before having been beaten by the Italian club in the semi-final in both 1958 and 1969. It is a draw Sir Alex Ferguson predicted in an interview yesterday and will see him come up against defender Jaap Stam for the first time since he left Old Trafford in 2001. Liverpool's draw offers them the chance to avenge their quarter-final defeat by Leverkusen in 2002.

The Center has followed several issues since the election days that were of concern, including the arrest of Renamo representatives in the Manica, Niassa, and Nampula provinces, delayed poll openings in rural areas of Zambezia, and low voter turnout. The Center will maintain its presence in Mozambique until the conclusion of the elections and then will publish a comprehensive report. Read President Carter's Mozambique Election Trip Report The Carter Center is very concerned about a number of irregularities observed during the provincial tabulation, including polling station tally sheets results lacking credibility, problems with the tabulation software, mismatched numbers of polling stations and tally sheets, and mistrust between political party representatives in the provincial Technical Secretariat for Election Administration (STAE). No province submitted results by the legal deadline, and the Center found it difficult to acquire clear and reliable information on the progress of tabulation. These and other concerns provide evidence of serious weaknesses in Mozambique's vote tabulation, and as a result, the Center cannot verify the accuracy of the provincial counting process at this time. The CNE reviews rejected tally sheets sent to Maputo from the provinces in a closed plenary session. Former U.S. President and Carter Center Chair Jimmy Carter has previously asked the CNE to maintain a clear record of reasons for the rejection or acceptance of these tally sheets and to allow nonpartisan observers to examine the rejected tallies. The Center repeats its request for full observer access to this record to contribute to the transparency and credibility of the final results process. The Center was impressed by the generally peaceful postelection environment and the genuine commitment of most Mozambicans to the legal requirements of vote tabulation. Although the Center does not expect these irregularities to alter the overall outcome of the presidential election, they do undermine the credibility of Mozambique's electoral authorities. In addition, any errors in the tabulation of legislative election results could lead to the incorrect distribution of seats. The Center is confident the findings of the parallel vote tabulation carried out by the domestic observer groups in the Electoral Observatory serve as a useful register against which to assess the overall election results. Provincial Tabulation Carter Center observers generally were granted access to review the entry of polling station results at computer terminals in the Provincial Electoral Commissions, although this access was uneven, and in one province, police and electoral officials obstructed the Center's observer. In another province, only one computer terminal was available to observers, and district results were not available for review. Also of importance, observers were unable to examine rejected tally sheets in all provinces. Tabulation was delayed in all provinces, and no province met the legal requirement of submission of results to the CNE by Dec. 9. A variety of reasons were advanced for the delays, including late reception of material from districts, tabulation software flaws, and misunderstandings between political party representatives. Provincial counting has been characterized by political mistrust, and in some provinces, Renamo representatives to the STAE obstructed the opening of warehouses with election materials. In a number of cases, Carter Center observers found tally sheets with unrealistically high voter turnout, including multiple instances of polling stations in Niassa and Tete recording a 100 percent turnout and more than 90 percent support for Frelimo. Given the low turnout nationwide (ranging from 30-40 percent), ballot boxes appear to be stuffed at polling stations in the Tete districts of Changara, Chifunde, and Tsangano, as well as in the Niassa districts of Metarica and Marrupa, and in the Gaza district of Chicualacuala. In some of these areas, Carter Center observers had reported an intimidating environment during the campaigns, and opposition party agents had problems in getting credentials. A final polling station list with registration book numbers and numbers of registered voters was never made available to political parties or observers. This list, described by the CNE as a \"state secret,\" is essential because it determines the number and location of polling stations and should coincide with the database used for the tabulation software. The reasons for such secrecy are not clear, and it is still unknown how many registered voters or physical polling stations existed on election day. Errors in the software resulted in the generation of extra tally sheets, creating confusion for political parties and election observers. According to STAE, the \"phantom tally sheets\" were produced when data were entered from polling stations with more than one voter register book. It appears that STAE has taken steps to address this problem, but its existence constitutes a fertile ground for allegations of fraud. Following the 1999 and 2003 elections, The Carter Center recommended timely production of credible and secure tabulation software. As a result of these and other difficulties in receiving clear and full information, the Center is unable to verify the accuracy of the provincial counting process at this time. National Tabulation The Center's observers had adequate access to the reclassification of invalid ballots at CNE headquarters, although on some occasions it was limited to specific times during the day. All invalid ballots are sent to the CNE in Maputo for reclassification where CNE representatives from Frelimo and Renamo, working in teams of two, examine each ballot paper. The Center noted a striking incidence of invalid ballots from Niassa and Tete provinces with a consistently applied pattern of additional ink marks that were mostly seen on ballots that would have otherwise been for Renamo. Necessarily, both party representatives present at the reclassification room considered those ballots void. The Center is aware that Renamo's leadership has announced it will not accept the results. Although final results were due Dec. 17, the Center encourages all candidates and their supporters to continue to participate in a climate of dialogue and to use legal channels for the resolution of any election disputes that may arise following the CNE's announcement. The Center also welcomes the positive involvement of nonpartisan Mozambican civil society organizations, such as members of the Electoral Observatory, and encourages their assessment of the tabulation and results process. As noted in previous statements, the Center anticipates the Constitutional Council will ensure that valid concerns with the conduct of the elections will be addressed properly. #### The Carter Center was founded in 1982 by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, in partnership with Emory University, to advance peace and health worldwide. A not-for-profit, nongovernmental organization, the Center has helped to improve life for people in more than 65 countries by resolving conflicts; advancing democracy, human rights, and economic opportunity; preventing diseases; improving mental health care; and teaching farmers to increase crop production.

Na continua\u00e7\u00e3o da observa\u00e7\u00e3o das elei\u00e7\u00f5es presidenciais e legislativas mo\u00e7ambicanas realizadas a 1 e 2 de Dezembro, o Carter Center tem monitorizado o apuramento dos resultados nas capitais provinciais e a reclassifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos votos inv\u00e1lidos na Comiss\u00e3o Nacional de Elei\u00e7\u00f5es (CNE) em Maputo. O Carter Center tem acompanhado v\u00e1rias quest\u00f5es desde os dias das elei\u00e7\u00f5es que s\u00e3o mat\u00e9ria de preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o, incluindo a deten\u00e7\u00e3o de representantes da Renamo-UE nas prov\u00edncias de Manica, Niassa e Nampula, os atrasos verificados na abertura das assembleias de voto na Zamb\u00e9zia e a fraca aflu\u00eancia dos eleitores. At\u00e9 que todo o processo chegue ao fim, o Carter Center continuar\u00e1 activo em Mo\u00e7ambique e, nessa altura, ir\u00e1 a publicar um relat\u00f3rio abrangente. O Carter Center est\u00e1 muito preocupado com o n\u00famero de irregularidades observado durante o apuramento provincial, incluindo resultados pouco cred\u00edveis em editais das assembleias de voto, problemas com o software, n\u00fameros das assembleias de voto que n\u00e3o conferem com os editais e a falta de confian\u00e7a entre os representantes dos partidos pol\u00edticos no Secretariado T\u00e9cnico da Administra\u00e7\u00e3o Eleitoral (STAE) provincial. Nenhuma prov\u00edncia cumpriu o requisito legal de apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados, e o Centro achou dif\u00edcil obter informa\u00e7\u00f5es claras sobre o progresso do apuramento. Em resultado destas e de outras dificuldades de receber informa\u00e7\u00e3o clara e completa, o Carter Center n\u00e3o pode certificar a exactid\u00e3o do processo de contagem provincial neste momento. A CNE procede \u00e0 revis\u00e3o dos editais rejeitados numa sess\u00e3o plen\u00e1ria \u00e0 porta fechada. O antigo Presidente e Chefe do Centro Carter pediu anteriormente \u00e0 CNE que mantivesse um registro claro das raz\u00f5es para a rejei\u00e7\u00e3o ou aceita\u00e7\u00e3o destes editais e que permitisse que observadores n\u00e3o partid\u00e1rios examinassem os editais rejeitados. O Carter Center repete o seu pedido de acesso dos observadores a este registro para contribuir para a transpar\u00eancia e credibilidade dos resultados finais do processo. O Carter Center ficou impressionado com o ambiente p\u00f3s-eleitoral na generalidade pac\u00edfico, bem como pelo compromisso genu\u00edno da maior parte dos mo\u00e7ambicanos em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos requisitos legais do apuramento dos votos. Embora n\u00e3o se preveja que as irregularidades alterem o resultado global das elei\u00e7\u00f5es presidenciais, elas minam a credibilidade das autoridades eleitorais mo\u00e7ambicanas. Para al\u00e9m disso, quaisquer erros no apuramento dos resultados das elei\u00e7\u00f5es legislativas podem conduzir a uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o incorrecta dos assentos. A confian\u00e7a do Carter Center nos resultados globais das elei\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 corroborada pelos resultados do apuramento paralelo efectuado por grupos de observadores nacionais congregados no Observat\u00f3rio Eleitoral. Apuramento Provincial Os observadores do Carter Center tiveram acesso, na generalidade, \u00e0 revis\u00e3o da introdu\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados das assembleias de votos nas terminais de computadores das Comiss\u00f5es Provinciais de Elei\u00e7\u00f5es (CPEs). Contudo, este acesso n\u00e3o foi uniforme e, numa prov\u00edncia, a pol\u00edcia e os agentes eleitorais obstru\u00edram o trabalho de um observador. Numa outra prov\u00edncia, apenas uma terminal de computadores estava dispon\u00edvel para os observadores e os resultados distritais n\u00e3o estavam dispon\u00edveis. Um outro aspecto importante \u00e9 que em todas as prov\u00edncias os editais rejeitados n\u00e3o foram colocados \u00e0 disposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos observadores. Verificou-se um atraso na contagem provincial em todas as prov\u00edncias, e nenhuma prov\u00edncia cumpriu o requisito legal de apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados \u00e0 CNE at\u00e9 o 9 de Dezembro. Foi avan\u00e7ada uma s\u00e9rie de raz\u00f5es para justificar atrasos, incluindo a recep\u00e7\u00e3o tardia do material dos distritos, falhas no software de apuramento e malentendidos entre os representantes dos partidos pol\u00edticos. A contagem provincial foi caracterizada pela falta de confian\u00e7a pol\u00edtica e, em algumas prov\u00edncias, os representantes da Renamo-UE no STAE impediram a abertura dos armaz\u00e9ns contendo materiais para as elei\u00e7\u00f5es. Em alguns casos, os observadores do Carter Center acharam editais com uma aflu\u00eancia de eleitores irrealisticamente elevada, incluindo v\u00e1rios casos de assembleias de voto nas prov\u00edncias de Niassa e Tete, que registraram aflu\u00eancias de 100% e mais de 90% para o partido Frelimo. Considerando a fraca aflu\u00eancia a n\u00edvel nacional (situada entre os 30% e 40%), torna-se claro que houve enchimento das urnas nas assembleias de voto nos distritos de Changara, Chifunde e Tsangano (Tete), assim como nos distritos de Metarica e Marrupa (Niassa) e no distrito de Chicualacuala (Gaza). Em algumas destas zonas, os observadores do Carter Center reportaram um ambiente de intimida\u00e7\u00e3o durante as campanhas e os agentes dos partidos pol\u00edticos da oposi\u00e7\u00e3o tiveram problemas em obter credenciais. N\u00e3o chegou a ser disponibilizada aos partidos pol\u00edticos, nem aos observadores, uma lista final das assembleias de voto contendo os n\u00fameros dos cadernos e o n\u00famero dos eleitores registrados. Esta lista, descrita pela CNE como sendo um \"segredo do Estado\", \u00e9 essencial porque determina o n\u00famero e a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o das assembleias de voto e deveria coincidir com a base de dados usada para o software do apuramento. N\u00e3o est\u00e3o claras as raz\u00f5es deste \"secretismo\" e ainda n\u00e3o se conhece o n\u00famero real de eleitores registrados bem como das assembleias de voto f\u00edsicas que existiram no dia das elei\u00e7\u00f5es. Os erros no software resultaram na gera\u00e7\u00e3o de um n\u00famero adicional de editais, criando confus\u00e3o aos partidos pol\u00edticos e aos observadores eleitorais. De acordo com o STAE, os \"editais fantasma\" eram produzidos quando eram introduzidos os dados das assembleias de voto com mais do que um caderno de registro de eleitores. Parece que o STAE tomou medidas com vista a sanar este problema, mas a sua exist\u00eancia constitui um terreno f\u00e9rtil para as alega\u00e7\u00f5es de fraude. Ap\u00f3s as elei\u00e7\u00f5es de 1999 e 2003, o Carter Center recomendou a produ\u00e7\u00e3o atempada de um software de apuramento cred\u00edvel e seguro. Apuramento Nacional O acesso dos observadores \u00e0 reclassifica\u00e7\u00e3o foi aceit\u00e1vel, embora em algumas ocasi\u00f5es se tenha limitado a per\u00edodos espec\u00edficos durante o dia. Todos os votos inv\u00e1lidos s\u00e3o enviados \u00e0 CNE em Maputo para efeitos de reclassifica\u00e7\u00e3o, onde os representantes da CNE, da Frelimo e da Renamo-UE, a trabalharem em equipas de duas (2) pessoas, examinam cada boletim de voto. O Carter Center verificou uma incid\u00eancia not\u00f3ria de votos inv\u00e1lidos das prov\u00edncias de Niassa e de Tete, com um padr\u00e3o constante de marcas de tinta adicionais. Estes padr\u00f5es foram constatados essencialmente em boletins de voto que tinham sido para a Renamo-UE. Necessariamente, os dois representantes dos partidos presentes na sala de reclassifica\u00e7\u00e3o consideraram esses boletins como sendo nulos. Estamos cientes que a direc\u00e7\u00e3o da Renamo-UE anunciou que n\u00e3o ir\u00e1 aceitar os resultados. Embora os resultados finais devessem ter sido anunciados no dia 17 de Dezembro, o Carter Center encoraja todos os candidatos e seus apoiantes a continuarem a participar num ambiente de di\u00e1logo e que utilizem canais legais para a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o de quaisquer diverg\u00eancias eleitorais que possam surgir ap\u00f3s o an\u00fancio da CNE. O Carter Center tamb\u00e9m sa\u00fada o envolvimento positivo das organiza\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o partid\u00e1rias da sociedade civil mo\u00e7ambicana, tais como os membros do Observat\u00f3rio Eleitoral, e encoraja a sua avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do processo de apuramento dos resultados. Tal como se assinalou em declara\u00e7\u00f5es anteriores, o Carter Center prev\u00ea que o Conselho Constitucional ir\u00e1 garantir que as preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es v\u00e1lidas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 forma como as elei\u00e7\u00f5es foram conduzidas sejam devidamente analisadas. #### O Carter Center foi fundado em 1982 pelo ex- Presidente dos Estados Unidos Jimmy Carter e a sua mulher, Rosalynn, em parceria com a Universidade de Emory, para promover a paz e a sa\u00fade em todo o mundo.

The flyby distance is uncertain and an Earth impact cannot yet be ruled out. The odds of impact, presently around 1 in 300, are unusual enough to merit special monitoring by astronomers, but should not be of public concern. These odds are likely to change on a day-to-day basis as new data are received. In all likelihood, the possibility of impact will eventually be eliminated as the asteroid continues to be tracked by astronomers around the world. The Orbit of 2004 MN4 The orbit of 2004 MN4 about the Sun is shown in blue. Much of the asteroid's orbit lies within the Earth's orbit, which is the outermost white circle. The positions of the asteroid and the Earth are shown for December 23, 2004, when the object was about 14 million km (9 million miles) away from the Earth. This object is the first to reach a level 2 (out of 10) on the Torino Scale. According to the Torino Scale, a rating of 2 indicates \"a discovery, which may become routine with expanded searches, of an object making a somewhat close but not highly unusual pass near the Earth. While meriting attention by astronomers, there is no cause for public attention or public concern as an actual collision is very unlikely. New telescopic observations very likely will lead to re-assignment to Level 0 [no hazard].\" This asteroid should be easily observable throughout the coming months. The brightness of 2004 MN4 suggests that its diameter is roughly 400 meters (1300 feet) and our current, but very uncertain, best estimate of the flyby distance in 2029 is about twice the distance of the moon, or about 780,000 km (480,000 miles). On average, an asteroid of this size would be expected to pass within 2 lunar distances of Earth every 5 years or so. Most of this object's orbit lies within the Earth's orbit, and it approaches the sun almost as close as the orbit of Venus. 2004 MN4's orbital period about the sun is 323 days, placing it within the Aten class of NEAs, which have an orbital period less than one year. It has a low inclination with respect to the Earth's orbit and the asteroid crosses near the Earth's orbit twice on each of its passages about the sun. Possible Positions of 2004 MN4 on April 13, 2029 The cloud of possible positions of asteroid 2004 MN4 relative to Earth on April 13, 2029 is shown in white. The Moon's orbit is also shown, for scale. The blue arrow indicates the direction of motion of the cloud as it sweeps past the Earth. A tiny portion of the cloud intersects the Earth. A slight dip in the cloud due to the Earth's gravity is clearly evident. The length of the cloud is directly related to current uncertainties in our knowledge of this new object's orbit. As astronomers track this asteroid over the coming weeks and months, the orbit will become better determined and the cloud will shorten, converging on a true position which, in all likelihood, will be well removed from the Earth. 2004 MN4 was discovered on 19 June 2004 by Roy Tucker, David Tholen and Fabrizio Bernardi of the NASA-funded University of Hawaii Asteroid Survey (UHAS), from Kitt Peak, Arizona, and observed over two nights. On 18 December, the object was rediscovered from Australia by Gordon Garradd of the Siding Spring Survey, another NASA-funded NEA survey. Further observations from around the globe over the next several days allowed the Minor Planet Center to confirm the connection to the June discovery, at which point the possibility of impact in 2029 was realized by the automatic SENTRY system of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office. NEODyS, a similar automatic system at the University of Pisa and the University of Valladolid, Spain also detected the impact possibility and provided similar predictions.

The maximum Torino and Palermo Scale values are listed, as well as the number of tabulated potential impacts and their corresponding cumulative Palermo Scale value and cumulative impact probability. The observation set used for the analysis is also listed. Certain parameter values depend upon the specific impact event in question, but they change little among the various table entries. For this reason we tabulate only mean values for these parameters: V impact - Velocity at atmospheric entry.\n- Velocity at atmospheric entry. V infinity - Relative velocity at atmospheric entry neglecting the acceleration caused by the Earth's gravity field, often called the hyperbolic excess velocity. (V infinity 2 = V impact 2 - V escape 2 , where V escape = ~11.2 km/s is the Earth escape velocity.)\n- Relative velocity at atmospheric entry neglecting the acceleration caused by the Earth's gravity field, often called the hyperbolic excess velocity. (V = V - V , where V = ~11.2 km/s is the Earth escape velocity.) H - Absolute Magnitude, a measure of the intrinsic brightness of the object.\n- Absolute Magnitude, a measure of the intrinsic brightness of the object. Diameter - This is an estimate, based on the absolute magnitude, and assuming a uniform spherical body with visual albedo p V = 0.154. Since the albedo is rarely well determined the diameter estimate should be considered quite rough, but in most cases will be accurate to within a factor of two.\n- This is an estimate, based on the absolute magnitude, and assuming a uniform spherical body with visual albedo = 0.154. Since the albedo is rarely well determined the diameter estimate should be considered quite rough, but in most cases will be accurate to within a factor of two. Mass - This estimate assumes a uniform spherical body with the computed diameter and a mass density of 2.6 g/cm 3 . The mass estimate is somewhat more rough than the diameter estimate, but generally will be accurate to within a factor of three.\n- This estimate assumes a uniform spherical body with the computed diameter and a mass density of 2.6 g/cm . The mass estimate is somewhat more rough than the diameter estimate, but generally will be accurate to within a factor of three. Energy - The kinetic energy at impact: 0.5 * Mass * V impact 2. Measured in Megatons of TNT.\nImpact Table Legend See our Introduction for a more extensive explanation of these terms. Date The calendar date (UTC) of the potential impact.\nDistance The minimum distance on the target plane (scaled b-plane) from the LOV to the geocenter, measured in Earth radii. For these purposes the radius of the Earth, 6420 km, includes some allowance for the thickness of the atmosphere.\nWidth The one-sigma semi-width of the LOV uncertainty region, measured in Earth radii.\nSigma Impact The lateral distance in sigmas from the LOV to the Earth's atmosphere. Zero indicates that the LOV intersects the Earth. It is computed from (Distance - 1)/Width.\nSigma LOV The coordinate along the Line Of Variations (LOV). This value is a measure of how well the impacting orbit fits the available observations. Zero indicates the best-fitting, central (nominal) orbit and the further from zero, the less likely the event: Roughly 99% of all the uncertainty region lies between -3 and +3. Sentry explores out to Sigma LOV = +/-5.\nStretch LOV The stretching is the semimajor axis of the local linear uncertainty region. It describes how fast one moves across the target plane as Sigma LOV changes, and is measured in Earth radii per sigma. The local probability density varies inversely with the stretching, and thus larger stretching values will generally lead to lower impact probabilities.\nImpact Probability The probability that the tabulated impact will occur. The probability computation is complex and depends on a number of assumptions that are difficult to verify. For these reasons the stated probability can easily be inaccurate by a factor of a few, and occasionally by a factor of ten or more.\nImpact Energy The kinetic energy at impact, based upon the computed absolute magnitude and impact velocity for the particular case, and computed in accordance with the guidelines stated for the Palermo Technical Scale. Uncertainty in this value is dominated by mass uncertainty and the stated value will generally be good to within a factor of three.\nPalermo Scale The hazard rating according to the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale, based on the tabulated impact date, impact probability and impact energy.\nTorino Scale The hazard rating according to the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, based on the tabulated impact probability and impact energy.", "title": "2004 MN4 Impact Risk", "url": "http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/2004mn4.html", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041230023237/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/2004mn4.html"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Last Updated\nJan 17, 2000\nThe Newly Adopted Torino Impact Hazard Scale Assessing Asteroid And Comet Impact Hazard Predictions In The 21st Century Near Earth Objects Scale Helps Risk Communication (NASA - July 22, 1999)\nDealing With the Impact Hazard: An International Project (IAU - July 22, 1999)\nTorino Impact Scale Created To Assess Earth-Asteroid Close Appro aches (MIT - July 22, 1999)\nThe Torino Scale (Ames Research Center - July 22, 1999)\nNew Torino Scale Measures Asteroid Threat (explorezone.com - July 22, 1999) Events Having No Likely Consequences\n(White Zone) 0 The likelihood of a collision is zero, or well below the chance that a random object of the same size will strike the Earth within the next few decades.

Erin Robicheaux\n256th Brigade Combat Team Public Affairs\nBAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 22, 2004 \u2014 In a collective effort to help heal the people of Iraq, Company C, 199th Forward Support Battalion (FSB), 256th Brigade Combat Team, collaborated with several units from Camp Liberty to conduct a medical screening at a local school. On Dec. 18, units from the 18th Military Police Brigade, 16th MP Brigade, 617th MP Brigade, 307th Psychological Operations Battalion, and the Iraqi Highway Patrol (IHP) joined the medics of the 256th BCT at the Shatt Al Arab School in hopes of curing some of the common ailments that might be plaguing the children. Maj. Alan Kabakoff, with the 16th MP Brigade, explained that humanitarian missions like this play a vital role in winning the war on terror, although sometimes it's hard to see. \"It's like fire prevention,\" he said, \"Everyone knows that it works, it's just hard to prove, unless something bad happens.\" \"We saw a lot of runny noses and coughing, but the main thing that we were happy to see was that the kids were in good spirits,\" U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Jason Escoyne, 199th Forward Support Battalion Kabakoff has worked with the Iraqi Highway Patrol on several missions and said that the unions have always proven to be successful. They have linked up to distribute shoes, school supplies, and at one time even Beanie Babies. He said that you never know what one simple act of kindness can lead to or what the long term effects will turn out to be. \"These people want the same things that we do,\" Kabakoff said. \"They want safe schools, safe homes, and safe areas to raise their kids. The IHP and U.S. forces working together proves that they (the IHP) are not puppets of the government.\" Staff Sgt. Jason Escoyne, Co. C, 199th FSB, was involved in getting the vital signs of the children and said that luckily they didn't find anything seriously wrong with anyone. \"If they had anything wrong at all it was mainly just the common cold,\" he said. \"We saw a lot of runny noses and coughing, but the main thing that we were happy to see was that the kids were in good spirits.\" The collective group of soldiers handed out soccer balls, candy, and school supplies, which no doubt, contributed to the excitement of the children, but it was also an effort to calm their fears. \"Some of them (the kids) were a little frightened at first,\" Escoyne noted. \"I don't think that the majority of them had ever seen a thermometer before.\" The medics cured this ailment by demonstrating on themselves and also by showing the children that their classmates, who went before them weren't harmed in the process. U.S. Army Maj. Whit Gallaspy, from Bogalusa, La., a physician with Company C, 199th Forward Support Battalion, does a head to toe assessment of a little boy at a local Baghdad school Dec. 18. U.S. Army photo by Spc. Erin Robicheaux Sgt. Jeanne Marie Crochet, Co. C, 199th FSB, works as a pediatric nurse in her civilian field. She said the illnesses they encounter here in Iraq were not so different from the common cold season in the states. \"This is the busy season for the common cold, even at home, but that was the main sickness that we saw here,\" she said. In addition, Crochet said that a lot of the kids had impacted ears which are easily cured with warm water and hydrogen peroxide. Unfortunately, the supplies for the medics are very limited right now. \"I'm extremely spoiled at my (civilian) job with equipment and supplies,\" she said, \"Slowly, we're getting the things in that we need, but for the most part we have been dealing with the bare minimum.\" Crochet added that she has taken it for granted to have a machine that will tell you all of the vital signs in seconds. She said that even doing a very simple thing like that took a while with the kids, because they just didn't have the technology to do it quickly. Crochet's job was to do a complete head to toe assessment of the children after all of their vitals had been taken. She conducted an eyes, ears, nose, and throat evaluation and worked her way through all of the systems. The kids were screened for pulmonary, cardio, and gastro-intestinal illnesses. The pediatric medications were also a big issue, but the team worked around them as much as they could. \"We have no pediatric meds here, so we are having to convert what we could in order to get the children well,\" Crochet said. Maj. Whit Gallaspy is a physician with the 199th FSB. He said the operation was a huge success. He admits that the kids were a little frightened at first, but once they realized that the soldiers were there to help them, they really warmed up. He also said the outlook for continuing missions such as this one is very hopeful. \"I think that the opportunities are almost endless for the 256th medical staff to do this type of thing and establish trust and good will with the people,\" Gallaspy said. \"We can take care of some of the medical problems that are out there.\"", "title": "Medics Provide a U.S. Army \"Band-Aid\"", "url": "http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/Dec2004/a122204wm2.html", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041223230925/http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/Dec2004/a122204wm2.html"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Accomplishments: Education\nObjectives include: increasing enrollment and improving the quality of primary and secondary education, ensuring that classrooms have sufficient materials for the start of the new school year in October, facilitating community involvement, training teachers, implementing accelerated learning programs, and establishing partnerships between U.S. and Iraqi colleges and universities.

The first, strongest quake on 26 December, at 0058 hours GMT, had the magnitude of 8.9 on the Richter Scale, followed by a second severe quake (0421 GMT). Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, India and Thailand have been affected as well as Malaysia, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Considerable numbers of deaths have already been reported, and figures can be expected to rise in the coming days. The tsunamis have caused large scale damage to infrastructures, including health facilities. According to the latest information received, the scale and magnitude of the tsunamis seem to have been much less destructive in Malaysia, Bangladesh and Myanmar than in other countries, particularly in Sri Lanka, where the greatest level of needs seems to now concentrate. Possible needs in the health sector and WHO's actions At this stage, it is vital to assess the health situation as precisely as possible, and reach all the affected areas. WHO gives priority to rapid health assessment by supporting the efforts of national and local counterparts. In Sri Lanka, a senior WHO official is on the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) evaluation team due to arrive in the country today\nIn Indonesia, WHO is joining the Ministry of Health in a rapid assessment of the situation in Northern Sumatra to leave tomorrow while a Joint UN Mission will be deployed later in the week\nIn Thailand and Myanmar the respective WHO Representatives are working closely with the Ministry of Health to assess affected areas in these countries.\nIn India WHO is in touch with the local government officials and the local UNICEF offices for regular updates of the situation. The Office of the WHO Representative is monitoring the situation with regard to the status of relief measures/operations, health system status and population displacement / relief camps Current figures concerning injured people indicate that hospitals will have to manage mass casualties with appropriate surgical and medical care. While national counterparts can provide the necessary human resources and systems, international partners will have to ensure the provision of necessary supplies. WHO is preparing to supply at least15 New Emergency Health Kits (each kit is designed to cover the basic health needs of 10,000 persons for three months) and 13 trauma kits (each covering 100 interventions) to the countries in the Region.\nWHO is sending four New Emergency Health Kits (NEHK) tomorrow (28 December) to Colombo, Sri Lanka, with the support of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In Sri Lanka alone, there are already 250 temporary camps hosting people made homeless by the tsunami. Conditions such as overcrowding and inadequate shelter provide favorable conditions for acute respiratory infections, which can represent a major cause of death, especially for children, if left untreated. South East Asia is endemic for malaria and dengue fever. Flooding and stagnant water create favorable conditions for the mosquito vector. Overcrowding facilitates mosquito bites and therefore transmission. WHO is setting in place a strict monitoring of the epidemiological situation trough the roll back malaria regional program and the regional Denguenet Poor quality and quantity of water and insufficient sanitation, overcrowding and poor hygiene in temporary camps will bring forward the risk for outbreaks of different diarrhoeal diseases. Thorough and sustained water purification is an absolute priority. WHO is providing chlorine and water purification tablets to partners\nIn order to be prepared against possible outbreaks WHO is mobilizing at least 15 diarrhoeal kits (each kit is designed to treat 100 SEVERE cases of diarrhea and/or cholera) Apart from biological pollution, the possibility that the environment be polluted by leaks or overflows from flooded chemical factories and warehouses must also be taken into consideration. Water can be contaminated by gasoline and oil leaking from damaged vehicles. WHO programs for water and sanitation and for international chemical safety have been alerted Dead bodies do not pose any health threat, but they feed fears and can divert precious attention and resources from effective relief efforts. Technical guidance and rational decisions based on sound scientific evidence are another priority need for the health of all the affected and surrounding populations. WHO is working on strengthening health coordination and evidence-based decision making in all affected countries in the region. Coordinating joint action for health is critical. To this end WHO is: strengthening the capacity of its South East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) to ensure harmonization of regional relief operation\ncollaborating with UNDAC and other UN bodies\nworking closely with national authorities Resources Financial support has been received from the Government of Italy and funding for immediate action has been provided by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) . Given the magnitude of the disaster, needs are anticipated to be large, and WHO will revert shortly on the requirements.

One industry forecaster -- JupiterResearch -- says as much as 10 percent of the U.S. population could be using VOIP phone services by the year 2009.\nThe bad news? The cable companies look to be the ones positioned to benefit most of all, for all the usual reasons that big companies win in the communications world: the ability to bundle and bill for multiple services and the big budgets to afford aggressive marketing (see Report: VOIP Growth Won't Benefit All and Report: MSOs Scoring With VOIP).\nThe JupiterResearch report, \u201cBroadband Telephony: Leveraging Voice Over IP to Facilitate Competitive Voice Services,\u201d states that about 1 million U.S. households will be using VOIP services by the end of next year, more than double the current total. That group will swell to 12.1 million by 2009.\n\u201dNext year will be important for continuing VOIP momentum as far as building customer awareness,\u201d says Joe Laszlo, senior analyst at JupiterResearch. And he says cable companies are in the driver\u2019s seat for dominating VOIP services:\n\u201cIt\u2019s the cable companies\u2019 game for the next few years. That\u2019s not to say that specialized VOIP companies like Vonage Holdings Corp. and Packet8 won\u2019t compete, just that they don\u2019t have the marketing muscle the cable companies do and must use a more focused approach. The cable companies are well-positioned for offering VOIP as a bundle with their existing video services.\u201d\nFor wireline carriers, VOIP is a lower revenue service than a regular landline phone connection, but the services will be helpful when selling service bundles that include high-speed data connections. \u201cTheir pressing issue is not to have VOIP, but to add video services,\" Laszlo says. \"They look at it that the customer doesn\u2019t care if telephony services are IP-based or not but that they must have a bundle that competes with the cable guys.\u201d\nAs noted at last week's UBS Investment Research media conference, VOIP services are gaining a fast following and often this comes at the expense of incumbent phone company access lines:\nCablevision Systems Corp. (NYSE: CVC - message board) announced it had surpassed 250,000 VOIP customers after reporting just under 200,000 at the end of the third quarter. It is currently adding 1,000 customers a day, despite not offering local number portability. The company expects to add number portability next year, which should cause an increase in customers.\nVonage stated that it had 276,000 customers at the end of the third quarter, having added customers at a rate of about 27,000 per month.\nTime Warner Cable estimates it will have more than 200,000 telephony customers by year-end and is adding roughly 10,000 customers per week. The UBS report notes that Time Warner Cable is now fully deployed in all its territories and has said that 75 percent of its new customers were porting numbers, indicating a switch of primary lines. UBS predicts that Time Warner Cable, which has 10.9 million basic cable subscribers, and a roughly 72 percent overlap with the Bells, will get more aggressive with marketing its VOIP bundle next year.\nOf course, many of the wireline incumbent carriers are hedging the revenue they're losing to VOIP players with gains from increasing numbers of wireless subscribers. The JupiterResearch report found that younger consumers were least likely to turn to traditional carriers for service and the least likely to use landline telephony at all. Twelve percent of 18- to 24-year-olds say their wireless phone is their only phone. \"For attracting young adults, VOIP\u2019s biggest competitor may prove to be mobile operators, not the Bell companies,\" Laszlo says.\n\u2014 Chris Somerville, Senior Editor, Next-Generation Services", "title": "Networking the Telecom Industry", "url": "http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?site=lightreading&doc_id=64433", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20050515055620/http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=64433&site=lightreading"}]}

Thousands of people are reported missing, including hundreds of Western tourists who had thronged to luxury tourist resorts in Thailand and Sri Lanka to celebrate New Year holidays.\nMillions were rendered homeless by the tsunamis that lashed the coastal regions of 11 nations, causing severe damage in at least seven countries following a massive 9.0-magnitude earthquake off Sumatra in Indonesia.\nThe international Red Cross said that it believes the death toll could rise to more than 100,000, with one official calling it \"a disaster of unprecedented proportion.\"\nUNICEF executive director Carol Bellamy said that children could account for up to a third of the dead.\nAn Indonesia official said that three-fourths of the western coastline of Sumatra was washed away. Most of the deaths in Indonesia were in the northwestern province of Aceh at the tip of Sumatra. Rescue crews and international volunteers were still trying to reach cut-off areas even as separatist rebels announced a truce to allow people to search for missing people.\nThe unbearable stench of decomposing corpses spread over the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, where fresh water, food and fuel were in short supply. Hundreds of bodies lay scattered in the streets.\nAid workers and volunteers from across the world have joined the locals in Indonesia and Sri Lanka to retrieve the rotting corpses from canals, building ruins and waterlogged fields.\nAuthorities in the tsunami-stricken South Asian nations lack medicines and relief supplies to cope up with the worst natural calamity in 40 years.\nThe wild waves, as high as 10-meters, smashed into the coastal districts of several countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Malaysia. Tsunami, which means a harbor wave in Japanese, can travel up to 500 miles an hour.\nDespite the mass cremation and burial of thousands of bodies, corpses still float in canals, lay strewn on the beaches or even hang in the trees across the devastated south Asian nations as the rescue workers and relief volunteers reach the remote locations.\nWith thousands of bodies rotting and infrastructures in tatters, authorities and medical relief workers fear an epidemic. David Nabarro, head of crisis operations for the World Health Organization, said the main threat to life now is communicable diseases associated with a lack of clean water and sanitation.\n\"There is certainly a chance that we could have as many dying from communicable diseases as from the tsunami,\" Nabarro told a news conference in Geneva.\nNabarro said local hospitals and health services in affected regions were already overwhelmed by the initial impact.\nThe Times of India reported that the largest relief operation in human history is woefully short of medicines, food and other relief supplies as thousands crowd into temporary shelters.\nThe situation is feared to be even worse in India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where rescue teams headed Wednesday and found some of the survivors. India's toll of nearly 12,500 included at least 7,000 on the islands closer to Myanmar and Indonesia than to the Indian mainland.\nOn one island, the surge of water killed two-thirds of the population.\n\"One in every five inhabitants in the entire Nicobar group of islands is either dead, injured or missing,\" a police official told The Times of India.\nThe risk of communicable diseases or an epidemic of cholera or other waterborne diseases looms large in the affected regions. Rescuers have been told to hold their breath while using their bare hands, axes or shovels to dig through piles of wrecked buildings and debris to retrieve bodies.\n\"People should be buried, and the animals should be destroyed and disposed off before they infect the drinking water. It's a massive operation,\" U.N. disaster relief coordinator Jan Egeland said.\n\"Drinking water for millions has been polluted. ... It can cause diseases. ... Also, acute respiratory disease always comes in the wake of disasters,\" Egeland said.\nMany of the bodies were already decomposing in the heat, underlining the growing health risk.\nOfficials in India have begun extensive distribution of water-purifying chlorine tablets and oral dehydration solution to prevent deaths. Also safety masks are being distributed to people in the affected areas.\nA WHO spokesperson in New Delhi said the possibility of waterborne diseases is quite high in the region. \"We have to look out for ways of providing safe drinking water to the displaced and provide them proper sanitation,\" she said.\nThe worst affected was Sri Lanka, where more than 28,000 people are confirmed dead and thousands still missing. At least 800 people were killed when a train was flung off the rail track by the killer waves. The country has requested that WHO supply \"emergency health kits\" that can cater to 10,000 people for three months.\n\"The biggest health challenges we are facing are the spread of waterborne diseases, particularly malaria and diarrhea, as well as respiratory tract infections,\" Hakan Sandbladh, spokesman for International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said.\nThe situation is similar in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Thailand, where relief agencies are distributing preventive medicines to counter an epidemic.\nInternational relief agencies are supplying clean drinking water in the affected regions and also setting up mobile latrines for the survivors.\nHundreds of planeloads of medicines and relief material are on the way to tsunami-stricken South Asian nations. The armies, air force and naval units of affected countries are working to provide succor to the survivors of worst quake in 40 years.\nIndonesia and Sri Lanka together accounted for nearly 65,000 deaths, and news reports pouring in from the affected regions suggest that the death toll is expected to rise by the tens of thousands.\nHundreds of bodies have been recovered from the sea, pushing the death toll to a staggering 85,000.\nWhile authorities ran out of body bags in Indonesia's Aceh region, there was not enough wood to cremate thousands of victims in southern India.\nThe estimated death toll in Thailand doubled after 700 bodies were found in the wreckage of hotels on one stretch of beach on the mainland north of Phuket Island.\nKhao Lak beach, in Phang Nga Province, is now thought to be the site of the most casualties. Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said the final toll in his nation would cross the 2,000 mark.\nMore than 20 countries have pledged emergency aid worth more than $80 million, and several Asian nations have sent naval ships carrying supplies and doctors to devastated areas.\nU.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, rejecting comments from a top U.N. official that rich countries were being \"stingy,\" said the international community would need to give billions of dollars in aid. Washington doubled its pledge to $35 million. Australia increased its aid to $27 million.\n\"A lot of the economies, or sectors of the economies, of the affected countries have been close to destroyed, and it is going to require a great deal of rebuilding and a great deal investment,\" Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said.\nMore than 5 million people have been rendered homeless across South Asia by the killer waves. Many of the displaced people were staying in shrines, schools or temporary relief camps. International aid agencies are building temporary shelters for the homeless, providing them with drinking water and setting up latrines.\nNot many people in the affected countries had heard about tsunamis until the ocean unleashed havoc on Sunday.\nIndian officials say they failed to recognize or sound an alert in the two hours it took the killer waves to hit Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\"In the absence of instrumentation, we could not have known that the earthquake in Sumatra would lead to tsunami on our coasts,\" India's Minister of State for Science and Technology and Ocean Development Kapil Sibal told reporters.\n\"It is not a phenomenon that has occurred in this part of the world,\" he said. \"If we had had any inkling, we could have reacted faster.\"\n\"Once we came to know of the magnitude of the earthquake near Sumatra, we should have reacted,\" V.S. Ramamurthy, secretary in the Department of Science and Technology said.\n\"We lost 2? hours. That was the first mistake we made as the earthquake was on the wrong side of Sumatra to impact the Pacific Rim countries,\" he said.\nSibal said around 80 percent of tsunamis occur in Pacific Rim countries, and the data provided by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center would not have had much relevance for India.\nSibal announced India would install its own tsunami warning system.\nIn India, saris killed several women bathing in the sea when the gigantic tsunami waves hit the southeast coast. The women, caught in the surging waters, could not escape after their saris got entangled in seaweed and bushes washed in by the sea. Even those who ran for safety were trapped after bushes and debris caught hold of their saris, the Deccan Chronicle reported.\n\"I tried hard to pull out a woman from the waves, but her legs got entangled in her sari,\" one of the witnesses recalled. \"Despite trying many times, I could not free her legs. Then my hands also got entangled in the sari. Somehow I managed to free myself, and she was washed away.\"\nThe last major quake in the region was in 2001, killing 25,000 people in western state of Gujarat, India.\nCopyright \u00a9 2001-2004 United Press International", "title": "Epidemic threatens as tsunami toll hits 85,000", "url": "http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20041229-123330-5516r", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20050113101332/http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20041229-123330-5516r"}, {"language": "fr", "maintext": "Le diaporama du jour\n0 / 10 05/03/2016 - Un porcelet peint aux couleurs du drapeau tricolore, pour les besoins d'une action coup de poing d'un collectif d'\u00e9leveurs \"Sauvons l'elevage francais\", dans une grande surface de la r\u00e9gion rennaise (ouest de la France)\n1 / 10 05/03/2016 - Le soleil se couche sur le port de Manille, o\u00f9 est amarr\u00e9 le navire militaire am\u00e9ricain \"USS Blue Ridge\"\n2 / 10 05/03/2016 - Une femme se couvre le visage,alors que la police anti-\u00e9meutes turque fait usage de gaz lacrymog\u00e8nes pour disperser une manifestation de soutien au quotidien Zaman, \u00e0 Istanbul\n3 / 10 05/03/2016 - Des danseurs mont\u00e9s sur \u00e9chasses, devant le palais de la Culture, \u00e0 Abidjan pour l'ouverture de la 9e \u00e9dition du festival MASA (March\u00e9 des arts du spectacle africain)\n4 / 10 05/03/2016 - Une patrouille de la police mont\u00e9e britannique en tenue anti-\u00e9meutes \u00e0 Londres, avant un match de Premier League entre Tottenham Hotspur et Arsenal\n5 / 10 05/03/2016 - Le magnat des m\u00e9dias australien Rupert Murdoch (g), 84 ans, et sa nouvelle \u00e9pouse, l'ancien mannequin am\u00e9ricain Jerry Hall, 59 ans, posent sur le parvis de l'\u00e9glise Saint-Bride, \u00e0 Londres, apr\u00e8s la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie religieuse\n6 / 10 05/03/2016 - Des participants \u00e0 une parade de carnaval gay et lesbien dansent dans une rue de Sydney\n7 / 10 05/03/2016 - Duel entre la Chinoise Li Xiaoxia (d) et la Ta\u00efwanaise Cheng I-Ching en demi-finale des Championnats du monde de tennis de table au stade Malawati de Shah Alam, en Malaisie\n8 / 10 05/03/2016 - Une route enneig\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de Beaufort en France", "title": "Accueil", "url": "http://www.afp.com/english/newsml/stories/041229202127.cdzu4kt0.html", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160305173400/http://www.afp.com/"}]}

Kenneth Blackwell refused to appear at a deposition on Monday, December 27. The deposition was part of an election challenge lawsuit filed at the Ohio Supreme Court. Meanwhile John Kerry is reported to have filed a federal legal action aimed at preserving crucial recount evidence, which has been under GOP assault throughout the state.\nRichard Conglianese, Ohio Assistant Attorney General, is seeking a court order to protect Blackwell from testifying under oath about how the election was run. Blackwell, who administered Ohio's November 2 balloting, served as co-chair of the Bush-Cheney campaign.\nJames R. Dicks, Miami County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, filed a motion to block a subpoena in his county while Conglianese filed to block subpoenas in ten key Ohio counties.\nPresident George Bush, Vice-President Richard Cheney and White House Political Advisor Karl Rove received notice that they will be deposed Tuesday and Wednesday, December 28 and 29. The trio\u2019s Ohio attorney, Kurt Tunnell, so far claims his clients have not been properly served. Under Ohio law, the Republican-dominated Ohio Supreme Court is responsible for serving the three.\nMeanwhile, the Election Protection legal team has collected new statements under oath describing more voting and vote-counting problems on November 2.\nVoters in Trumbull County have testified that on Election Day they received punch-card ballots where holes were already punched for Bush. Meanwhile, a notarized affidavit signed by Angela Greene, who voted at Whitehall Yearling High School in central Ohio's Franklin County, stated that one of the malfunctioning electronic voting machines at her polling place was delivered without a cartridge \u2013 meaning votes cast might have gone uncounted.\nIn Miami County, Blackwell certified a 98.6% turnout in the Concord Southwest precinct, comprised of 520 votes for Bush and 157 for Kerry. This statistically improbable turnout has all but 10 of the 689 registered voters casting their ballots on Election Day. A preliminary canvas by The Free Press of less than half the precinct found 25 registered voters admitting they had not voted, meaning the official tally was almost certainly fraudulent.\nThe nearby Concord South precinct certified a 94.27% voter turnout, with 468 alleged votes for Bush versus 182 for Kerry. Miami County is included in the election challenge since it somehow reported nearly 19,000 additional votes after 100% of the precincts had reported on Election Day.\nIn Madison County, where public records requests were filed to obtain voting records, the voting results provided by the Madison County Board of Elections came directly from a private company, Triad Governmental Systems, Inc. An email dated November 29, 2004 from Brandon Sandlin of Triad reads as follows: \u201cHello to all in Madison County! Attached you will find the cumulative report (oh49unov.pdf) with over and under votes reported as well as the official abstract (oh49abs.pdf). These reports may be printed for your records and then mailed to the state along with your other certification reports.\u201d Coming from a private corporation, Triad's letter underscores the barriers to making a reliable independent public assessment and recount of Ohio's presidential tally.\nIn Mahoning County, the Washington Post reported new affidavits documenting electronic \"vote hopping\" from Kerry to Bush. This means voting machines highlighted the choice for Bush before the voter recorded a choice of his or her own. The legal team has been told by a computer expert that this may mean the machines were pre-set on a Bush vote as a default. The Free Press has obtained dozens such sworn statements of vote hopping.\nThe legal team is also exploring new evidence that in Coshocton, Ohio, write-in votes wrongly defaulted to Bush when run through the voting machine.\nOn December 23, U.S. Representative John Conyers, Jr. of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote a letter to Triad President Brett A. Rapp inquiring whether or not Triad possessed remote access capabilities for any of the 41 counties where its election tabulation software or computers are in use.\nAttorneys for the election challenge team are also exploring ties between Triad and the Tallahassee-based company Datamaxx. Ohio public safety and police agencies use the Datamaxx DMPP2020 software for its LEADS computer systems. Datamaxx makes numerous remote access products that law enforcement can access with mobile and handheld computers. CommSys, a Dayton, Ohio-based company provides technical support for Datamaxx.\nThe Free Press has also obtained a list of all voting machines assigned in Franklin County, including serial numbers. The list contains at least 42 machines originally assigned to predominantly African-American and inner city wards that voted 80% for Kerry, and where voters waited in line for three hours and more on Election Day. These 42 machines were blacked out on the list, raising the question of whether these were among the 68 machines the Franklin County Board of Elections has admitted holding back in the warehouse despite obvious shortages at certain polling places. Affidavits from poll workers confirm that numerous requests for more machines were made through election day, but that few if any were delivered.\nFranklin County Board of Elections Chair Bill Anthony claims that low-level poll workers refused to accept the machines assigned by high-ranking election officials. But he has yet to provide specific details. Anthony has repeatedly claimed that he was a watchdog for Democratic interests in the election, but he was a political appointee of the Republican Secretary of State.\nUnder Ohio election law, the members, directors and deputy directors of all boards of elections are assigned by the Secretary of State. They hold these paying jobs at his discretion regardless of whether they are Democrat or Republican. A major argument of those who claim Ohio\u2019s 2004 presidential election was fraud-free centers on the myth that local precincts are run as bipartisan operations, deflecting charges of partisan interference while failing to account for the fact that the principles all owe their jobs to the Secretary of State, who in this case served as co-chair of the state's Bush-Cheney campaign.\nThese problems add to the established pattern of problems that favored Bush at Kerry\u2019s expense.\nDespite the legal stonewalling, lawyers directing the election challenge case are still pursuing evidence-gathering efforts. Three expert witnesses are scheduled to be deposed on Thursday and Friday, including specialists in statistics and vote counting irregularities.\nThe challengers are seeking a January 4th hearing before the Ohio Supreme Court. Members of Congress meet in Washington on January 6 to evaluate the Electoral College vote. Led by Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), it is virtually certain numerous members of the Congressional Black Caucus will challenge that vote. But the assent of a Senator is required for the challenge to go forward, and thus far none has definitively confirmed.\nDespite ducking depositions, Blackwell is escalating his public appearances in hopes of becoming Ohio\u2019s next governor. On January 12, 2005, Blackwell is scheduled to speak at the exclusive Scioto Country Club on the topic of \u201cEthics in Leadership.\u201d Blackwell became nationally known after disenfranchising voters who had not registered on 80-pound bond paper stock under an archaic Ohio law. He reversed longstanding Ohio tradition that allowed voters to cast provisional votes by county by ruling that none of these votes would be counted unless the voter was in the right precinct. He also was recently censured for running a \u201cget out the vote\u201d campaign for Issue One, a Constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and spousal benefits.\nMeanwhile, Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) was reported to be filing a brief in federal court in relation to the activities of Triad and events in Hocking County, where serious questions have arisen as to the integrity of the recount. Kerry previously circulated a letter to all 88 counties requesting information on how the vote was conducted. The Kerry campaign raised millions of dollars from grassroots supporters with the promise that \"all votes would be counted.\" But the Democrats are not known to have helped fund the legal work of the Green and Libertarian Parties and their grassroots Election Protection supporters, who have raised the money for the shoestring campaign that has kept the legal challenges alive thus far.\nAn Election Protection rally in downtown Columbus has been set by Rev. Jesse Jackson for 2pm Monday, January 3. It will be followed by a national gathering in Washington January 6, to take place as Congress evaluates the Electoral College and the Ohio votes, which have allegedly given George W. Bush another term in the White House.\nRevised and updated 1:32 pm December 28, 2004\n--\nBob Fitrakis, Steve Rosenfeld and Harvey Wasserman are co-authors of the upcoming OHIO'S STOLEN ELECTION: VOICES OF THE DISENFRANCHISED, 2004, a book and film project from http://freepress.org.

These efforts proved successful today when Jeff Larsen and Anne Descour of the Spacewatch Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, were able to detect and measure very faint images of asteroid 2004 MN4 on archival images dating to 15 March 2004. These observations extended the observed time interval for this asteroid by three months allowing an improvement in its orbit so that an Earth impact on 13 April 2029 can now be ruled out. As is often the case, the possibility of future Earth impacts for some near-Earth objects cannot be entirely ruled out until the uncertainties associated with their trajectories are reduced as a result of either future position observations, or in this case, heretofore unrecognized, pre-discovery observations. When these additional observations were used to update the orbit of 2004 MN4, the uncertainties associated with this object's future positions in space were reduced to such an extent that none of the object's possible trajectories can impact the Earth (or Moon) in 2029. In the accompanying diagram, the most likely position of asteroid 2004 MN4 is shown at the end of the blue line near the Earth on 13 April 2029. However, since the asteroid's position in space is not perfectly known at that time, the white dots at right angles to the blue line are possible alternate positions of the asteroid. Neither the nominal position of the asteroid, nor any of its possible alternative positions, touches the Earth, indicating that an Earth impact in 2029 is ruled out. Updated Set of Possible Positions of 2004 MN4 on April 13, 2029 The passage of the asteroid by the Earth in 2029 alters its subsequent trajectory and expands the asteroid's position uncertainty region (i.e., the line of white dots increases in extent) so the asteroid's subsequent motion is less certain than it was prior to the 2029 close Earth approach. However, our current risk analysis for 2004 MN4 indicates that no subsequent Earth encounters in the 21st century are of any concern.

(V infinity 2 = V impact 2 - V escape 2 , where V escape = ~11.2 km/s is the Earth escape velocity.)\n- Relative velocity at atmospheric entry neglecting the acceleration caused by the Earth's gravity field, often called the hyperbolic excess velocity. (V = V - V , where V = ~11.2 km/s is the Earth escape velocity.) H - Absolute Magnitude, a measure of the intrinsic brightness of the object.\n- Absolute Magnitude, a measure of the intrinsic brightness of the object. Diameter - This is an estimate, based on the absolute magnitude, and assuming a uniform spherical body with visual albedo p V = 0.154. Since the albedo is rarely well determined the diameter estimate should be considered quite rough, but in most cases will be accurate to within a factor of two.\n- This is an estimate, based on the absolute magnitude, and assuming a uniform spherical body with visual albedo = 0.154. Since the albedo is rarely well determined the diameter estimate should be considered quite rough, but in most cases will be accurate to within a factor of two. Mass - This estimate assumes a uniform spherical body with the computed diameter and a mass density of 2.6 g/cm 3 . The mass estimate is somewhat more rough than the diameter estimate, but generally will be accurate to within a factor of three.\n- This estimate assumes a uniform spherical body with the computed diameter and a mass density of 2.6 g/cm . The mass estimate is somewhat more rough than the diameter estimate, but generally will be accurate to within a factor of three. Energy - The kinetic energy at impact: 0.5 * Mass * V impact 2. Measured in Megatons of TNT.\nImpact Table Legend See our Introduction for a more extensive explanation of these terms. Date The calendar date (UTC) of the potential impact.\nDistance The minimum distance on the target plane (scaled b-plane) from the LOV to the geocenter, measured in Earth radii. For these purposes the radius of the Earth, 6420 km, includes some allowance for the thickness of the atmosphere.\nWidth The one-sigma semi-width of the LOV uncertainty region, measured in Earth radii.\nSigma Impact The lateral distance in sigmas from the LOV to the Earth's atmosphere. Zero indicates that the LOV intersects the Earth. It is computed from (Distance - 1)/Width.\nSigma LOV The coordinate along the Line Of Variations (LOV). This value is a measure of how well the impacting orbit fits the available observations. Zero indicates the best-fitting, central (nominal) orbit and the further from zero, the less likely the event: Roughly 99% of all the uncertainty region lies between -3 and +3. Sentry explores out to Sigma LOV = +/-5.\nStretch LOV The stretching is the semimajor axis of the local linear uncertainty region. It describes how fast one moves across the target plane as Sigma LOV changes, and is measured in Earth radii per sigma. The local probability density varies inversely with the stretching, and thus larger stretching values will generally lead to lower impact probabilities.\nImpact Probability The probability that the tabulated impact will occur. The probability computation is complex and depends on a number of assumptions that are difficult to verify. For these reasons the stated probability can easily be inaccurate by a factor of a few, and occasionally by a factor of ten or more.\nImpact Energy The kinetic energy at impact, based upon the computed absolute magnitude and impact velocity for the particular case, and computed in accordance with the guidelines stated for the Palermo Technical Scale. Uncertainty in this value is dominated by mass uncertainty and the stated value will generally be good to within a factor of three.\nPalermo Scale The hazard rating according to the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale, based on the tabulated impact date, impact probability and impact energy.\nTorino Scale The hazard rating according to the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, based on the tabulated impact probability and impact energy.", "title": "2004 MN4 Impact Risk", "url": "http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/2004mn4.html", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041230023237/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/2004mn4.html"}, {"language": "en", "maintext": "Last Updated\nJan 17, 2000\nThe Newly Adopted Torino Impact Hazard Scale Assessing Asteroid And Comet Impact Hazard Predictions In The 21st Century Near Earth Objects Scale Helps Risk Communication (NASA - July 22, 1999)\nDealing With the Impact Hazard: An International Project (IAU - July 22, 1999)\nTorino Impact Scale Created To Assess Earth-Asteroid Close Appro aches (MIT - July 22, 1999)\nThe Torino Scale (Ames Research Center - July 22, 1999)\nNew Torino Scale Measures Asteroid Threat (explorezone.com - July 22, 1999) Events Having No Likely Consequences\n(White Zone) 0 The likelihood of a collision is zero, or well below the chance that a random object of the same size will strike the Earth within the next few decades.

David Wu on Voting Suppression e-mail: author: Rep. David Wue-mail: mbatko@lycos.com This letter was sent by Rep. Wu on December 23, 2004. Rep. David Wu\nCongress of the United States\nHouse of Representatives\nWashington, DC 20515-3701\nDecember 23, 2004\nDear Mr. Batko:\nThank you for contacting me regarding your concerns about allegation of voting irregularities and fraud in our elector process. I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue,\nThe right to vote in a free election, and the right to have your vote counted, is an indispensable right. Without it, our democracy would not be possible. More than that, the public must have the confidence that the system is fair, and that the results of that process can win broad acceptance.\nUnfortunately, recent elections, marked by the closeness of the results, have highlighted some serious problems. In a 50-49 nation, questions about qualified voters not being able to vote, about valid votes not being counted, about equipment failing to function, or being unable to verify the results, threaten the stability as well as the fairness of our system of government.\nSince Election Day, thousands of Ohio citizens have reported difficulties and barriers in casting their vote. These reports include: long lines at polling places; electronic voting machines which malfunctioned; precincts reporting more voters than they had, or inexplicable numbers of votes cast; and disenfranchisement, particularly in high-population areas. I also understand concerns about the conflict of interest of having an official in charge of running elections in a key state also heading a presidential campaign. I agree that Ohio Secretary of State Blackwell's dual role calls into question any election decision he made that favored Republicans.\nI agree that we have an obligation to investigate the facts, to get a clear understanding of what happened, and to do everything we can to make sure that those problems are fixed. With just two short years until our next federal elections, Congress must act expeditiously to ensure that we correct any problems that may need fixing.\nIn response to widespread reports of voting irregularities, including faulty equipment, voter suppression tactics, and other problems, House Democrats have asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to undertake a systematic and comprehensive review of election irregularities throughout the nation. Also, the Election Assistance Commission will hold hearings on the 2004 electoral process. And on December 8, 2004, Congressman Conyers held a hearing to address the voting irregularities in Ohio.\nThe integrity of our democracy is at stake. We need to give the American people confidence that each and every vote will be properly counted and that the democratic electoral process is respected. Continuing to improve our election procedures will aid the work of restoring the people's trust in our democratic process. What is at stake here is not just a single presidential election but the right of all Americans to vote and to have those votes counted in all future elections.\nPlease know I care deeply about this issue, and I will work with my colleagues to ensure that our electoral system is above reproach. Thank you again for your letter.\nWith warm regards,\nDavid Wu\nMember of Congress add a comment on this article add a comment on this article", "title": "Rep.

The term voting irregularities generally refers to a broad array of complaints relating to voting and/or elections that may involve violations of federal voting rights and/or federal criminal law for which the Department of Justice (DOJ) has enforcement responsibilities. The Ranking Minority Members of several Congressional committees requested that we review activities at DOJ to help ensure voter access to the polls and actions to address allegations of voting irregularities. This report (1) identifies and describes changes DOJ has made since November 2000 to help ensure voter access to the polls; (2) identifies and describes actions that the Voting Section in DOJ's Civil Rights Division has taken to track, address, and assess allegations of election-related voting irregularities received between November 2000 and December 2003; and (3) assesses the Voting Section's internal control activities to help ensure relevant, accurate, and reliable recording and documentation of allegations of voting irregularities to accurately track actions taken in response to allegations and provide accurate and complete information to the public and congressional committees.\nSince November 2000, DOJ has implemented changes to help ensure voter access to the polls. The Voting Section emphasized the importance of its monitoring of election-day activities and increased its monitoring of these activities. The Voting Section also (1) placed a greater priority on protecting the voting rights of language minority voters; (2) placed a priority on enforcing and preparing for compliance with the federal statute to help ensure voting rights of overseas voters; (3) provided additional training to Assistant U.S. Attorneys on civil rights statutes to educate them about voters' rights; and (4) provided guidance to states regarding the implementation of sections of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) that DOJ enforces. The Attorney General directed the Civil Rights Division to work with civil rights leaders, state and local election officials, and U.S. Attorney Offices prior to election day in an effort to help ensure that citizens' voting rights are protected. The Attorney General also directed the Criminal Division to work with these same groups in helping to preserve ballot integrity and prevent election offenses. According to Voting Section officials, DOJ plans to help ensure voter access for the upcoming November 2004 election include increasing its monitoring of elections, coordinating with civil rights organizations, and establishing procedures for bringing the concerns of civil rights organizations about specific issues or jurisdictions to DOJ on or before election day in November 2004. The Voting Section has used several means of tracking allegations of voting irregularities and the Section's actions with regard to those allegations. Actions that Voting Section attorneys took to address allegations of voting irregularities initiated from November 2000 to December 2003 included contacting cognizant election officials at the state and local levels; obtaining data as appropriate; interviewing voters affected by alleged voting irregularities; meeting with minority groups; and assessing the merits of the allegations to determine what, if any, further action was needed. Regarding internal controls, we found that the Voting Section did not have a reliable method to consistently record and document telephone calls received alleging voting irregularities. The Voting Section plans to take several actions to address voting irregularities for the November 2004 election, including, among other things, using a telephone log similar to the one used for the November 2002 election. In addition, we found that the Voting Section did not routinely track its election-monitoring activities through its Interactive Case Management (ICM) system. The Voting Section said that it has plans to assign one identification number to track these activities in the future. Lack of specifics about allegations and actions limits DOJ's ability to have accurate and clear information to share with the public or Congress about the types of allegations received and actions taken. If the Voting Section collects more precise information about voter allegations, it is in a better position to assure the public that it has addressed allegations of voting irregularities. Moreover, if it documents actions taken more precisely, it is better able to reassure the public and Congress of its commitment to enforce federal voting rights statutes.", "title": "Reports and Testimony Report Abstract", "url": "http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-04-1041R", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20041024030948/http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-04-1041R"}]}

That same day, the movie industry association sent site operators a cease-and-desist order to stop them from hosting trackers that match BitTorrent users with copyrighted movies.\nLawsuits were also filed against the operators of BitTorrent trackers Centraltracker.org and Centraldownload.org.\nEdward Webber, owner of LokiTorrent, said it's only a matter of days before he's served a lawsuit specifically against him. The original suit didn't include names -- the defendant's were referred to as \"[John] Does 1-10\" -- because the MPAA only had IP and Web site addresses in the beginning. It wasn't until a judge allowed lawyers to subpoena Layered Technologies, Webber's ISP, and PayPal that they learned his name.\nFinding his name, however, wasn't difficult, since Webber and his contact information is publicly listed on the site's domain name registration, findable through a WHOIS (define) search.\nThe $30,000, Webber said, will fund the first month's legal expenses in what will likely be a protracted court battle with the MPAA and its deep pockets in Hollywood. He's looking for continued support from the P2P community and is scheduled to talk with lawyers with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) on Friday in the hopes they will support the case.\n\"Personally, it's ludicrous to be suing a tracker for copyright infringement that hosts no copyright material,\" he said. \"It's tantamount to suing the highway department for having roads that drug smugglers use. The random pirating of software just doesn't add up to being able to shut down the site.\"\nUnlike the traditional peer-to-peer (P2P) model, where a user downloads a complete file from another user's system, the BitTorrent technology strips torrent files into smaller pieces so that the downloading burden is shared by more people. And while the user is downloading their file, they are also uploading the pieces they've downloaded to other users, vastly improving file-sharing speeds across the board.\nSites like LokiTorrent, which host forums that index the torrent files in use, have been under increasing attack by the content industry. Earlier this month, popular BitTorrent tracking site Suprnova.org -- shut down its service. A similar site, Suprnova.com, according to the Web site, is a \"100% Legal\" BitTorrent tracker site, where visitors must register their name, e-mail address and pay a monthly fee to use the site.\nAt any given time, hundreds of copyrighted files are indexed by the sites. LokiTorrent, for example, features BitTorrent downloads for movies like \"The Grudge\" and PC games like \"Half-Life 2.\"\nLokiTorrent's site contains a \"terms and conditions\" disclaimer for all new site registrants, not taking responsibility for the torrents listed on its site, which are input by BitTorrent users. The disclaimer states users must gain \"written permission of the copyright owners\" before using any copyrighted material.\nThe MPAA's legal maneuvering is the latest in a string of moves by the content industry to shut down Web sites facilitating the downloading of pirated movies and music. To date, that effort has been led by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the form of hundreds of lawsuits against individual P2P users and the highly publicized Napster affair.\nBut as broadband use grows so does the ability to download huge movie files, prompting the movie industry to step up efforts. In a move to clarify the so-called Betamax ruling of the 1980s, the MPAA will argue before the Supreme Court next year that software developers should be liable for the illegal use of their applications. In November, the association announced its latest crop of suits against individual file-sharers.\nThe movie industry's actions have had mixed results. While the MPAA was able to shut down or force compliance with some BitTorrent forums, they are limited to site's hosted in the United States. LokiTorrent is registered by Webber in Portland, Maine, while Suprnova.org's site registration comes from Scottsdale, Ariz., according to domain registration records.\nOutside the United States, content companies have been largely ignored by BitTorrent sites. One recent cease-and-desist threat by Dreamworks lawyers from Keats, McFarland & Wilson serves as an example. Lawyers sent the Stockholm-based BitTorrent tracker site Pirate Bay an order telling them to stop because they were liable for infringing on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\nOne of the site's members, replied by e-mail in August:\n\"As you may or may not be aware, Sweden is not a state in the United States of America. Sweden is a country in northern Europe,\" the e-mail read. \"Unless you figured it out by now, U.S. law does not apply here. For your information, no Swedish law is being violated.\"\nMPAA officials were not available for comment at press time.\n(Updated to distinguish Suprnova.org from Suprnova.com)", "title": "BitTorrent Operator Bites Back at MPAA", "url": "http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3453321", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20050104090526/http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3453321"}]}

When this expanded view of the marketplace is considered, the resulting server market for shipments and redeployments with Linux is increased by 36% over net new shipments in 2004.\nAnother key finding of interest to independent software vendors and customers is predicted revenue growth for packaged applications and infrastructure software running on Linux, a market opportunity IDC forecasts will exceed $14 billion in the next four years, growing at a 2003-2008 compound annual rate of more than 44 percent.\n''This is the first authoritative and comprehensive snapshot of how people truly use Linux and it\u2019s not surprising for us to see that the adoption is far ahead of even some of the most optimistic estimates,'' said Stuart Cohen, CEO of OSDL.\nOther key findings from the IDC report include:\nThe combined worldwide market for desktops, servers, and packaged software running on Linux is forecast to grow at a 2003-2008 compound annual growth rate of 25.9 percent worldwide, reaching $35.7 billion by 2008. The worldwide market for software on Linux is forecast to exceed $14 billion by 2008 with a 2003-2008 compound annual growth rate of 44.3 percent. New and redeployed PCs running Linux is a market forecast to grow to $10 billion and 17 million units by 2008 with an installed base of over 42.6 million units. Servers running Linux as either a primary or secondary operating system is a market forecast to exceed $11 billion and 3.3 million units by 2008 with an installed base of more than 9.7 million units and a compound annual growth rate of 24.5 percent worldwide. The installed base of servers running Linux is 37 percent larger than installed base for net new systems shipped with Linux as a primary operating system alone in 2004. With this expanded view of the Linux market, this study takes into account segments not previously measured. This broader perspective considers systems that are reconfigured in the field with Linux as either a secondary operating system or as a replacement of the original operating system.\nThe study utilized existing IDC research conducted on server hardware, PC hardware, software, and other research programs in conjunction with new primary research, including a demand-side study that covered ten countries around the world on customer adoption, plans and perceptions relating to Linux. Some data inputs used in conjunction with IDC's syndicated research came from a study funded by OSDL.\n''When all manifestations of Linux operating systems are counted, Linux is clearly a mainstream solution,'' said Vernon Turner, group vice president and general manager of Enterprise Computing research at IDC. ''Today, IDC sees a shift where Linux server operating environment deployments are moving to favor the use of enterprise server hardware. This transition is being driven by the increasing robustness of Linux and the increasingly critical nature of the applications deployed on Linux.''\n''Linux is forecast to be the fasted growing server operating system environment, and the overall Linux solution stack is growing at a commensurate rate,'' concluded Cohen. ''What this research shows is the significant and increasing influence of Linux on the enterprise IT marketplace.''\nA summary of the IDC report is available on the OSDL Web site at IDC Report.\nThe new report, called Worldwide Linux 2004-2008 Forecast: Moving from Niche to Mainstream (IDC #32424), is now available from IDC.

Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand: Meet the Fockers.\nPHOTO: AP\nThe hunt is on for Oscars The race for the Oscars was heating up, with Martin Scorsese's The Aviator, Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby and the road movie Sideways dominating Hollywood's awards chatter. The phantom of the opera, is here!\nPHOTO: AP\nScorsese, always a bridesmaid but never the bride at the Oscars, may finally be in line for cinema's top honor with his epic biography of eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes, awards pundits said. \"It looks as if a Marty Scorsese film finally is flying high in the Oscar best picture race,\" said Tinseltown awards guru Tom O'Neil, adding that the film was pulling ahead because of its size, scope and overdue director. Despite turning out classics such as Taxi Driver and Goodfellas, Scorsese has never won the best director Oscar, heightening speculation among awards voters that 2005 may be the year to correct past oversights. The Aviator will no doubt lead with the most Oscar nominations and that has in the past overwhelmingly foretold the winner of the best picture award,\" said O'Neil, who runs the awards-monitoring Web site Goldderby.com. The Aviator picked up six Golden Globe nominations, including best drama film nods for director Scorsese and a lead actor nomination for Leonardo DiCaprio. The Globes, frequently seen as an Oscars bellwether, will be handed out on Jan. 16, just over a week before the 77th annual Oscar nominations are announced on January 24. However, the grand-scale Aviator faces intense competition from Eastwood's movie about a female boxer, starring Hilary Swank, and from Alexander Payne's critically adored movie about two ordinary men on a road trip, Sideways. Sideways, a moving yet funny film about two oddly-matched pals searching for happiness while on a wine-quaffing car trip, led the Golden Globe nods with seven and has also swept the US critical awards. The film by About Schmidt director Payne has picked up best picture honors from influential critics groups based in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Million Dollar Baby is also generating major Oscars buzz for best picture and best actress for Swank, for her turn as determined boxer Maggie Fitzgerald. She won the gong once before for 1999's Boys Don't Cry. Swank stars opposite the film's director, Eastwood, as Maggie's reluctant manager, and Morgan Freeman. \"Clint's status as a beloved academy member certainly helps to bolster his chances in the best-picture and best- director races,\" O'Neil said. Ironically, the three early favorites for the coveted best-picture Oscar have not been seen by wide audiences as they are in limited pre-Oscars release only in major US cities. Also packing serious Oscars heat, according to the pundits, are Finding Neverland, the story of Peter Pan author JM Barrie starring Johnnie Depp; Kinsey, starring Liam Neeson as the famed sexologist; and Closer, starring Jude Law and Julia Roberts in the story of a love quadrangle. Jamie Foxx is also the focus of major Oscar speculation as a contender for the best actor award, after turning in a remarkable performance as the late Genius of Soul,Ray Charles, in Taylor Hackford's biopic Ray. Foxx is likely to face off Don Cheadle for his role in the genocide-themed Hotel Rwanda, as well as Paul Giamatti for Sideways, Neeson for Kinsey, and DiCaprio for The Aviator, awards watchers said. In the best-actress race, Swank is expected to face competition from Annette Bening for her role as a London stage actress in Being Julia, Imelda Staunton for the 1950s abortion saga Vera Drake. In the early stakes, however, it was The Aviator that loomed as the movie player to watch ahead of the Feb. 27 Oscars show -- provided it does well at the box office following its general release. Aviator may have all of those plusses, but it can't prove victorious on Feb. 27 if it doesn't already look like a winner at the box office,\" O'Neil said.\nThis story has been viewed 661 times.\nAdvertising", "title": "Taipei Times", "url": "http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/12/31/2003217502", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20050108084407/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/12/31/2003217502"}]}

{"title": "Bush to Propose Major Overhaul of Social Security Benefits", "text": ["{{date|January 4, 2005}}", "Republicans and lobbyists close to President [[George W. Bush]] have reported that the White House will propose changing the formula for establishing initial Social Security benefit levels in order to cut guaranteed expenditures on future retirees, according to today's ''Washington Post''. The Social Security Administration would no longer use the increase in wages over a worker\u2019s lifetime to calculate retirees\u2019 first-year benefits but would use inflation rates instead. The new \u201cprice indexing\u201d formula will reduce individual benefits and overall Social Security outlays because the inflation rate typically is much lower than the rise in wages. The full impact of the change will be felt in the middle of the century.", "The Bush Administration proposal, which will be offered to Congress in February or March 2005, is part of an overall Social Security reform package that also would create \u201cpersonal investment accounts\u201d into which individual taxpayers could divert part of their payroll taxes. The White House believes that the shortfall in benefits created by the adoption of price indexing would be made up by capital gains from the stocks and bonds held by individual taxpayers in their personal investment accounts. ", "The move is akin to the private sector's migration from defined benefit retirement plans to defined contribution benefit plans such as 401(k)s as almost half of a worker\u2019s benefits will not be guaranteed by the year 2075. President Bush will support the move to price indexing for calculating initial benefits by pointing out that it was the approach recommended by his 2001 Commission to Strengthen Social Security.", "Benefits currently are calculated by averaging a worker\u2019s earnings in their 35 highest-paid years and adjusting earnings to factor in cost of living standards at the worker\u2019s retirement age.  Under the Bush proposal, rather than adjusting benefits on the basis of earnings growth, the calculation would be based on the increase in the consumer price index over those years.", "The implementation of \"price indexing\" would cut future Social Security costs by trillions of dollars. However, the cuts in guaranteed benefits for middle-class and some high-income workers would be substantial: 9.9% for workers retiring in 2022, over 25% for workers retiring in 2042, and 46% for workers retiring in 2075.", "Opponents of the price-indexing proposal point out that inflation-based calculations of benefits, by linking benefits to prices but not wage levels, would cut retirees out from future increases in living standards since it is wages and not prices that determine standards of living. While American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Policy Director John Rother concedes that many of the arguments of opponents are valid, price indexing is inevitable and must be viewed in the context of President Bush\u2019s total reform package. ", "Rother points out that Social Security benefits, which currently equal 42 percent of the earnings of an average worker retiring at age 65, would be reduced to 20% of pre-retirement earnings for future retirees, thus potentially freezing retirees into today\u2019s standard of living. However, Rother says that price indexing has to be linked to Bush\u2019s private investment accounts as income from the accounts give retirees the chance to make up the shortfalls.", "{publish}}\n{{archive}}"], "categories": ["Politics and conflicts", "North America", "United States", "George W. Bush"], "sources": [{"language": "en", "maintext": "Washington Post Staff Writers\nTuesday, January 4, 2005; Page A01\nThe Bush administration has signaled that it will propose changing the formula that sets initial Social Security benefit levels, cutting promised benefits by nearly a third in the coming decades, according to several Republicans close to the White House.\nUnder the proposal, the first-year benefits for retirees would be calculated using inflation rates rather than the rise in wages over a worker's lifetime. Because wages tend to rise considerably faster than inflation, the new formula would stunt the growth of benefits, slowly at first but more quickly by the middle of the century. The White House hopes that some, if not all, of those benefit cuts would be made up by gains in newly created personal investment accounts that would harness returns on stocks and bonds.\n_____Message Boards_____ \u0095 Post Your Comments\nBut by embracing \"price indexing,\" the president would for the first time detail the painful costs involved in closing the gap between the Social Security benefits promised to future retirees and the taxes available to fund them. In late February or March, the administration plans to produce its proposed overhaul of the system, including creation of personal investment accounts and the new benefit calculation.\n\"This is going to be very much like sticking your hand in a wasp nest,\" said David C. John, a Social Security analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation and an ally of the president. \"And the reaction will be similar.\"\nIn informal briefings on Capitol Hill, White House aides have told lawmakers and aides that Bush will propose the change in the benefits formula, an approach recommended by his 2001 Commission to Strengthen Social Security , according to congressional aides and lobbyists.\nCurrently, initial benefits are set by a complex formula that calculates workers' average annual earnings in their 35 highest-paid years and adjusts those earnings up from those years to reflect standards of living near that worker's retirement age. That adjustment is based on wage growth over that time span. Under the commission plan, the adjustment would be based instead on the rise of consumer prices.\nThe change would save trillions of dollars in scheduled expenditures and solve Social Security's long-term deficit, but at a cost. According to the Social Security Administration's chief actuary, a middle-class worker retiring in 2022 would see guaranteed benefits cut by 9.9 percent. By 2042, average monthly benefits for middle- and high-income workers would fall by more than a quarter. A retiree in 2075 would receive 54 percent of the benefit now promised.\n\"No decision has been made, but the administration is clearly leaning in that direction,\" said Michael Tanner, director of the libertarian Cato Institute's Project on Social Security Choice. \"I don't think anything else is seriously on the table.\"\nA former senior administration official who recently discussed Social Security strategy with Bush aides said the change in the indexing formula \"is assumed to be a part of any final solution.\"\n\"You've got the bitter medicine of changing the indexing, but to go along with that you've got the sweetener of the accounts,\" the former official said.\n\"There will be price indexing,\" said John Rother, policy director of AARP, the powerful seniors lobby.\nThe White House has been slowly building the case for the change. Last year's Economic Report of the President, written by the Council of Economic Advisers and signed by Bush, uses the Social Security commission's primary proposal to advocate overhauling the retirement system. Last month, the council's chairman, N. Gregory Mankiw, fingered the current system of \"wage indexing\" as a primary culprit for Social Security's problems.", "title": "Social Security Formula Weighed", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45726-2005Jan3.html?sub=AR", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210211041711/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45726-2005Jan3.html?sub=AR"}]}

Hundreds were issued their deportation orders on Christmas Eve, and similar conditions affect people from Aceh in Indonesia, where the quake was focused.\nThis article is currently a brief.

Unfortunately it does not seem to be available on the group's web site. Please do not mistake the below for article content, it is a press release for use in researching an article, and should be removed once the article has been developed sufficiently.\nMEDIA RELEASE\nCOMPASSION COULD START AT HOME \u2013 VISAS FOR SRI LANKANS COULD EASE THE SUFFERING OF HUNDREDS IN AUSTRALIA\nRefugee advocates have added their voices to calls from representatives of the Sri Lankan community for the federal government to recognize the suffering of hundreds of Sri Lankans on bridging visas and for 14 asylum seekers being held in detention.\n\u201cGranting humanitarian visas to these people would be a small gesture by the government, but would make a huge difference to the suffering of Sri Lankans already living in the Australian community,\u201d said Ian Rintoul, spokesperson for the Refugee Action Coalition.\nThe government has said that it is willing to consider taking Sri Lankans as humanitarian refugees, just as they did in the crisis in Kosovo, but Sri Lankans already in the Australian community are being overlooked. Compassion shouldn\u2019t end at the boundary of the migration zone,\u201d he said.\nWhile the federal government has announced it will consider fast tracking temporary visas for the families of Sri Lankan residents, the government has overlooked the plight of hundreds of Sri Lankans whose lives and families have been devastated by the catastrophe of the tsunami.\nThe offer will not apply to around 500 Sri Lankans presently on bridging visas. Many of theses people and their families have been living in the Australia for many years with families and lives established in the community.\nYet on Cristmas eve, the government sent letters to hundreds of these Sri Lankans requiring them to make arrangements to leave the country within 28 days.\n\u201cThis was inexcusable at the time, but given the catastrophe of the tsunami, to continue to refuse visas to these people and their families, is unforgivably cruel and spiteful,\u201d said Ian Rintoul, spokesperson for the Refugee Action Coalition. Sri Lankans who made inquiries to the Department of Immigration were told that they could extend the deadline for only one month.\n\u201cIn the circumstances is even more ridiculous to propose that these people should be forced to return to Sri Lanka,\u201d he said. \u201cMany have lost family members and have no homes to return to.\u201d\n\u201cIt is in the government\u2019s power to make a huge difference to the lives of hundreds of Sri Lankans and their families. It would cost them nothing, but so far the government has ignored the suffering of those that it can most easily assist,\u201d said Ian Rintoul.\nSimilar considerations apply to Achenese whose homeland suffered even greater devastation.\nSRI LANKAN ASYLUM SEEKERS IN DETENTION\nThere are 14 Sri Lankans being held in Baxter detention center. Ten of these are from that have been directly affected by the tsunami with whole families have been displaced and villages wiped out. While most have been able to confirm the safety of their parents, the fate of other imdediate family members is unknown.\nJust before Christmas one asylum seeker was deported to Sri Lanka. Following the deportation, other Sri Lankans at Baxter detention staged a hunger strike in a desperate attempt to draw attention to their circumstances. Now the tsunami has thrown their detention into sharp humanitarian relief.\n\u201cHumanitarian grounds alone demands the release of the Sri Lankans in detention and humanitarian visa to allow them to bring family members to Australia. How can the government square their compassionate aid efforts with the on-going suffering of Sri Lankans being detained by the Australian government?\u201d said Ian Rintoul.\nThe deportation of two Iranians from the same compound as the Sri Lankans in Baxter has added to the fears of refugee supporters that the government is using the tsunami to avoid media or community attention on unpopular decisions.\nFor more information contact, Refugee Action Coalition, Ian Rintoul, 0417 275 713, or Victorian Tamil community spokesperson Nagamuthu Wickiramasingham 0404 059 231", "title": "Australia to deport asylum seekers to Tsunami Zone", "url": "http://en.wikinews.org/w/index.php?title=Australia_to_deport_asylum_seekers_to_Tsunami_Zone&oldid=13234", "archive_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200516205120/https://en.wikinews.org/w/index.php?title=Australia_to_deport_asylum_seekers_to_Tsunami_Zone&oldid=13234"}]}

Unofficial figures compiled by Exhibitor Relations showed overall revenue for 2004 topped $9.4 billion, up 1.4 percent from the 2003 total of $9.27 billion. Official year-end figures, as well as three-day weekend totals, were scheduled to be released later in the week. \"Meet the Fockers\" set records for the biggest gross on New Year's Eve, with $12.2 million, and on New Year's Day, with $18 million. The previous New Year's Eve record was set in 2000 by \"Cast Away\" with $8.5 million. \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" had held the New Year's Day mark with $12.8 million. With no new major releases the final weekend of 2004, \"Meet the Fockers\" crushed the competition, including \"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,\" which finished in second place with $14.7 million, and \"The Aviator,\" which earned $11.2 million for third place. This weekend's top 12 films grossed an estimated $125.4 million, a 4.3 percent increase compared to $120.1 million for the same weekend last year. \"Meet the Fockers\" saw just a 7 percent decline at the box office from its opening week. The film has attracted an older audience interested in seeing De Niro, Hoffman and Streisand, as well as younger fans who like Stiller.

Astronomers have found the most powerful eruption in the universe using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. A super massive black hole generated this eruption by growing at a remarkable rate. This discovery shows the enormous appetite of large black holes, and the profound impact they have on their surroundings.The huge eruption was seen in a Chandra image of the hot, X-ray emitting gas of a galaxy cluster called MS 0735.6+7421. Two vast cavities extend away from the super massive black hole in the cluster's central galaxy. The eruption, which has lasted for more than 100 million years, has generated energy equivalent to hundreds of millions of gamma-ray bursts.\nRelated stories:\nThis event was caused by gravitational energy release, as enormous amounts of matter fell toward a black hole. Most of the matter was swallowed, but some of it was violently ejected before being captured by the black hole. \"I was stunned to find that a mass of about 300 million suns was swallowed,\" said Brian McNamara of Ohio University in Athens. \"This is as large as another super massive black hole.\" He is lead author of the study about the discovery, which is in the January 6, 2005, issue of Nature.Astronomers are not sure where such large amounts of matter came from. One theory is gas from the host galaxy catastrophically cooled and was swallowed by the black hole. The energy released shows the black hole in MS 0735 has grown dramatically during this eruption. Previous studies suggest other large black holes have grown very little in the recent past, and that only smaller black holes are still growing quickly.\"This new result is as surprising as it is exciting,\" said co-author Paul Nulsen of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass. \"This black hole is feasting, when it should be fasting.\"Radio emission within the cavities shows jets from the black hole erupted to create the cavities. Gas is being pushed away from the black hole at supersonic speeds over a distance of about a million light-years. The mass of the displaced gas equals about a trillion suns, more than the mass of all the stars in the Milky Way.The rapid growth of super massive black holes is usually detected by observing very bright radiation from the centers of galaxies in the optical and X-ray wavebands, or luminous radio jets. In MS 0735 no bright central radiation is found, and the radio jets are faint. The true nature of MS 0735 is only revealed through X-ray observations of the hot cluster gas.\"Until now we had no idea this black hole was gorging itself,\" said co-author Michael Wise of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass. \"The discovery of this eruption shows X-ray telescopes are necessary to understand some of the most violent events in the universe.\"The astronomers estimated how much energy was needed to create the cavities by calculating the density, temperature and pressure of the hot gas. By making a standard assumption that 10 percent of the gravitational energy goes into launching the jets, they estimated how much material the black hole swallowed.Besides generating the cavities, some of the energy from this eruption should keep the hot gas around the black hole from cooling, and some of it may also generate large-scale magnetic fields in the galaxy cluster. Chandra observers have discovered other cavities in galaxy clusters, but this one is easily the largest and the most powerful.NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala., manages the Chandra program for NASA's Space Mission Directorate, Washington.
